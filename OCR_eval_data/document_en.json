Although simulation of experimental data may be required for detailed quantitative analysis of protein-protein interaction by small-zone sizeexclusion chromatography, useful information is accessible from direct comparative examination of chromatograms. For instance, chromatograms may be obtained for an antigen interacting with two different Fabs (or other pairs of antibodies of the same molecular weight) in separate runs. If the two Fabs have different affinity for the antigen, and assuming the Stokes radii of the two different complexes are not substantially different, the Fab with the higher affinity for antigen generates the earlier elution position. If equimolar antibody and antigen concentrations are maintained and the concentration of one pair is systematically varied until the shape and position of the eluting peak matches that of another interacting pair, then relative affinity constants are inversely related to the antibody concentrations used. If elution positions can be matched, but not shape of peak, then assumption of rapid equilibrium may not be valid for one, or both, of the antibody-antigen pairs. Kinetic Limits of Rapid Equilibrium Assumption. The application of the above simulation for short-run-time HPLC is limited by the same consideration noted above for the large-zone procedures, namely, the failure to satisfy the rapid (instantaneous) equilibrium assumption. To estimate roughly the upper affinity limits within which the rapid equilibration assumption may be reasonable, consider a 15 -min run approximated as a sequence of 100 independent equilibration and transport steps. Each step represents $9 \\mathrm{sec}$, during which reequilibration must be attained. Since dilution occurs with each transport step, equilibration is limited by dissociation of complexes. Assuming a minimum of six dissociation halflives ( $98.4 \\%$ of complexes dissociated), the minimum value for the dissociation rate constant, $k_{\\mathrm{r}}$, can be estimated as $k_{\\mathrm{r}}=0.693 /(1.5 \\mathrm{sec}) \\sim 0.5$ $\\mathrm{sec}^{-1}$.

DOR-eGFP Is Available at the Cell Surface} GPCRs are membrane proteins present at the cell surface where they respond to extracellular stimuli. GPCRs traffic in and out the cell surface, and both receptor endocytosis and externalization regulate receptor activity (82-84). Several lines of evidence have suggested that the cell surface pool of DORs increases after various stimuli. Thus, chronic morphine treatment (85-88), deletion of the $m u$ opioid receptor (89), peripheral injury $(86,88)$, activation of purinergic receptors (67), administration of proalgesic compounds such as capsaicin $(67,88)$ and bradykinin $(90)$, and forced swim stress (91) have been suggested to promote the translocation of DORs to the cell surface (for a review, see (9)). Additionally, a few studies have shown that some of these pretreatments induce a gain of function of DOR agonists, as measured by electrophysiological or behavioral methods. This was interpreted as a result of receptor redistribution and increase of cell surface receptors $(85,89,92-96)$. Together, these observations have led to the proposal that, in some cases, delivery of a prestimulus is necessary to increase the efficacy of DOR agonists. However, this hypothesis is difficult to reconcile with a large number of other studies using delta opioid agonists. For example, these compounds can exert their locomotor $(24,35-40)$, antidepressant $(12-20,97)$, anxiolytic $(12,14,21)$, analgesic $(8,73$, 98-103), or proconvulsive $(17,104,105)$ effects independently of any prestimulus that would induce translocation of DORs to the cell surface. These pharmacological data rather indicate that DORs are available and can be activated under basal conditions. Using DOR-eGFP knockin mice, we examined fluorescence distribution in brain neurons, at the subcellular level. We performed a series of live-imaging experiments using primary striatal and hippocampal neurons cultured from mutant mice. We found that DOR-eGFP fluorescence was present at the cell surface of neurons under basal conditions, and that application of the agonists Met-enkephalin, deltorphin 2, or SNC80 to the media triggered a rapid (minutes) and massive (up to 100\\%) internalization of the fluorescent signal (Fig. 4a and (24)). We also investigated the subcellular localization of DOR-eGFP in tissues of knockin mice. In striatal, hippocampal, cortical, and DRG neurons, as well as in neurons in the olfactory bulb, DOR-eGFP fluorescence was clearly predominant at the cell surface (Fig. 4b-d and (24)). Further, as observed in primary culture, systemic administration of SNC80 induced a dramatic reduction of cell-surface fluorescence concomitant with the appearance of brightly fluorescent intracellular vesicles in DOR-eGFP-expressing neurons throughout the nervous system (Fig. 4b-d). This response was observed"

MARANER  Center for Theoretical Physics, Laboratory for Nuclear Science and INFN,  Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA 02139-4307, USA  (e-mail: maraner@ctp.mit.edu)  (Received March 10, 1997)  Geometric quantization procedures go usually through an extension of the original theory (pre-quantization) and a subsequent reduction (selection of the physical states). In this context we describe a full geometrical mechanism which provides dynamically the desired reduction.  1. The standard viewpoint on quantization: states, observables and time evolution The usual way to think of a physical system proceeds in two steps. First: kinematics, that is the specification of the possible states and of the observable quantities. Second: dynamics, that is the description of the time evolution of the representative point of the system over the space of all the possible states. As a very typical example we may think of Hamiltonian mechanics, whcre the states of a system with $n$-degrees of freedom are specified by the canonical variables $q^{\\mu}, p_{\\mu}, \\mu=1, \\ldots, n$, while observables are identified with smooth functions of $q$ and $p$. Dynamics is obtained by pointing out a privileged observable, namely the energy of the system $h(q, p)$, by means of the canonical flow generated on the phase space. Let us note that still at this classical level, it turns out that a very few of all the possible observables of the theory play a concrete role in the physical description of the system. Furthermore, the selection of relevant observables goes typically through dynamical considerations, making the sharp scparation of kinematics and dynamics an artificial one. Nevertheless the standard way to look at quantization moves from this viewpoint seeking a correspondence between the formal structures of classical and quantum mechanics: states, observables and time evolution. In order to make the quantization procedure a sensible one, that is capable to reproduce standard quantum mechanics, four conditions are usually required: $(Q 1)$ the correspondence is asked to be linear; $(Q 2)$ the constant function 1 has to be mapped on to the identity operator; $(Q 3)$ the Poisson brackets should become $i$ times the commutators; and $(Q 4)$ the canonical variables $q$ and $p$ should act irreducibly on the quantum Hilbert space. There are of course many critiques that can be moved to such an approach. As a matter of fact, it results that it is impossible to quantize the whole algebra of classical observables"

Important events in transformation may involve disregulation of pathways that control normal stem cell self-renewal, such as Notch, Wnt, LMO4, PTEN, and BMI1. In addition, the phenotypic heterogeneity found in human breast cancers best fits a stem cell model in which transformed stem or progenitor cells undergo aberrant differentiation. Using flow cytometry, we have identified a small population of cells within primary or metastatic human breast cancers that bear the cell surface phenotype CD44 $4^{+} \\mathrm{CD} 24^{-} /$lowESA+lineage ${ }^{-}$that have properties of tumor stem cells. As low as 200 of these cells are able to generate tumors in NOD-SCDD mice, while the vast majority of cells in these tumors that lack this phenotype are incapable of tumor formation, even when tens of thousands of cells are injected. Consistent with a stem cell model, the tumorigenic stem cells generate tumors that recapitulate the phenotypic heterogeneity found in the original tumors. Current therapies have been developed by virtue of their ability to induce tumor regression and may selectively target more differentiated cells in tumors, while leaving the tumor stem cell population intact, accounting for treatment resistance and relapse. More effective therapies will require the targeting and elimination of the tumor stem cell population in breast cancer patients. 51 Functional characterization of mammary stem cells in development and breast cancer M Rosen ${ ^{1}$, BE Welm ${ }^{2}$, SB Tepera ${ }^{1}$, F Behbod ${ }^{1}$, SL Grimm ${ }^{1}$, T Venezia ${ }^{3}$, MA Goodell ${ }^{3}$, TA Graubert ${ }^{4}$, Z Werb ${ }^{5}$, Y Li $^{5}$, HE Yarmus ${ }^{6}$} ${ }^{1}$ Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA; ${ }^{2}$ Department of Anatomy, University of California, San Francisco, California, USA; ${ }^{3}$ Center for Cell and Gene Therapy, Department of Pediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA; ${ }^{4}$ Division of Bone Marrow Transplantation and Stem Cell Biology, Washington University School of Medicine, St Louis, Missouri, USA; ${ }^{5}$ Baylor Breast Center, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas, USA; ${ }^{6}$ Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, USA Breast Cancer Res 2003, 5(Suppl 1):51 (DOI 10.1186/bcr710) Breast cancer is a genetically and clinically heterogeneous disease. Whether different target cells contribute to this heterogeneity, and which cell types are most susceptible to oncogenesis is still not well understood. Identifying mammary cell lineage markers is a prerequisite for elucidating the function of stem cells in mammary development and tumorigenesis, and especially for understanding preneoplastic progression. Our laboratory has used genetically engineered mice coupled with fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis and transplantation into the cleared mammary fat pad, as a model system in which to isolate and characterize functional mammary progenitors and stem cells. Taking advantage of approaches similar to those employed to isolate and characterize hematopoietic and epidermal stem cells, we identified a population of self-renewing, label retention cells, which excluded Hoechst dye and were present on fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis as sidepopulation (SP) cells. The SP cells and label retention cells represented approximately $0.5 \\%$ of mammary epithelial cells in the immature mouse. DNA microarrays have been employed to determine the gene expression profiles of these SP cells in comparison with the non-SP population. Approximately $75 \\%$ of the SP cells expressed stem cell antigen1(Sca-1). Sca-1 cells have been localized to the terminal end buds of growing ducts and as few as $1000 \\mathrm{Sca}-1^{+}$cells were able to generate mammary gland outgrowths containing luminal, alveolar and myoepithelial cells. In addition, no outgrowths were observed in Sca-1-mammary epithelial cell transplants. In different genetically engineered mice mammary tumor models Sca-1 expression levels, as well as several other putative markers of progenitors, including keratin- 6, have dramatically altered expression profiles. For example, Wnt-1 tumors express these markers and contain at least two populations of tumor cells, epithelial cells and myoepithelial cells that share secondary mutations such as loss of p53 and Pten, implying that they arose from a common progenitor. Mammary tumors arising in transgenic mice expressing $\\beta$ catenin and c-myc, downstream components of the canonical Wnt sig- naling pathway, also contain a significant proportion of myoepithelial cells as well as cells expressing keratin 6; however, progenitor cell markers and myoepithelial cells are lacking in mammary tumors from transgenic mice expressing Neu, $\\mathrm{H}$-Ras or polyoma middle $\\mathrm{T}$ antigen. Interestingly, K6 expression was also detected in the ductal epithelium of $\\mathrm{C} / \\mathrm{EBP} \\beta$ null mice, suggesting that germline deletion of this bZIP transcription factor alters mammary epithelial cell fate. These data suggest that the genetic heterogeneity observed in breast cancer results from the activation of specific oncogene and/or tumor suppressor-regulated signaling pathways in specific mammary progenitors. Finally, recent studies in several other laboratories have identified a comparable population of multipotent stem cells in the normal human breast as well as a population of tumorigenic stem cells in some breast cancers. Understanding the differences between normal and cancer stem cells may provide new therapeutic targets for the treatment of breast cancer.

Modulations of the synthesis of these paracrine growth factors by non-toxic therapeutic agents has not been fully investigated. Sodium phenylacetate $(\\mathrm{NaPa})$, a physiological metabolite of phenylalanine, has an antiproliferative effect against several human cancer cell lines. We have previously shown that $\\mathrm{NaPa}$ exhibits powerful anti-tumor activity against breast cancer MCF7-ras xenografts in nude mice. Moreover, in this model, we have observed that $\\mathrm{NaPa}$ can prevent tumor recurrence after tamoxifen treatment. Although glutamine depletion was proposed as a mechanism underlying $\\mathrm{NaPa}$ growth inhibition, protein prenylation, regulating cellular function of p21/ras, may also be inhibited by $\\mathrm{NaPa}$. We showed that $\\mathrm{NaPa}$ modifies the synthesis of growth factors secreted by MCF-7 and MCF-7ras tumor cells leading to cell proliferation inhibitions. This could explain in vitro and in vivo $\\mathrm{NaPa}$ inhibition of MCF-7ras cells, which secreted higher levels of these growth factors. It was hypothesized that inhibiting tumor angiogenesis will halt tumor growth and decrease metastatic potential. Anti-angiogenic agents targeting the tumor vasculature are expected to block the neovascularization and thereby prevent metastasis. We previously showed that carbomethyl benzylamide dextran (CMDB7) prevents tumor growth and tumor angiogenesis by binding to angiogenic growth factors, thereby preventing them from reaching their receptors on tumor or stromal cells. We showed that CMDB7 inhibited neovensal formation within the fibroblast growth factor 2-enriched matrigel in mice, and its anticancer effect was then tested in a metastatic breast cancer model. Human MDA-MB435 cells were injected into the mammary fat pad of nude mice, and breast tumors developed within 1 week; all the mice had lung metastases at 12 weeks. CMDB7 treatment for 10 weeks reduced the incidence of the lung metastases to 12\\%. Histological analysis showed markedly less tumor neovascularization in the CMDB7-treated mice. We studied the uptake of CMDB7 labeled with ${ }^{96} \\mathrm{~T} \\varepsilon$ in MCF-7ras-tumor-bearing mice. The blood clearance of ${ }^{96} \\mathrm{~T} \\varepsilon$ CMDB7s rigid and the liver, spen and kidney uptakes are weak. Our results confirm the non-toxicity of CMDB7 and the usefulness of CMDB7 in cancer therapy by targeting breast tumors. Associations of CMDB and $\\mathrm{NaPa}$ show a synergetic antiproliferative effect on the MCF-7ras cell line. We have synthesized new molecule esters of CMDB with phenyl-acetic acid. These new molecules, called $\\mathrm{NaPaC}$, are 100 -fold more efficient on the in vitro growth of these cells. $\\mathrm{NaPaC}$ inhibits the MCF-7ras tumor growth in nude mice 10 -fold more than the parental molecules. Moreover, $\\mathrm{NaPaC}$ have a strong antiangiogenic effect on the MCF-7ras tumors. This anti-angiogenic effect"

                "value": " Basic idea of the Bologna process is a competence-based teaching approach. Transition to this type of educational process due to controversial concepts and ambiguous categories of competences requires systematization [1]. European project \"Tuning Educational Structures\" (TUNING) offered 30 competences in three categories: instrumental, interpersonal and systemic [2]. The structure of the competences is complemented with one more component, which is general scientific competence, in the programs developed by the federal component of the natural and scientific cycle for the State Educational Standards (SES) of the third generation [3]: 1. General scientific competences: - ability to scientifically analyse problems, processes and phenomena, ability to use basic knowledge and research methods in practice; - ability to acquire new knowledge, including the use of modern educational and information technologies; - ability to use the knowledge of the modern physical world view and evolution of the Universe, space and time patterns, structure of matter in order to understand processes and phenomena of the nature; - understanding the role of physical laws for the environmental protection, environmental management, development and preservation of the civilization. 2. Instrumental competences: - ability to apply the knowledge about objects and phenomena in practice, including making hypotheses, theoretical models, analysing the limits of their applicability; - ability to use the fundamental physical theories knowledge to solve emerging fundamental and practical problems, self-learning; - readiness to apply analytical and numerical methods of problems solving using programming languages and systems, computer modelling tools. 3. Social, individual and general cultural competences: - mathematical and scientific literacy as a part of professional and human culture; - ability to prove allegations, as well as performance of other cognitive and communicative functions; - ability to define and realize perspective directions of intellectual, cultural, moral, physical and professional self-development and self-improvement; - persistence in achievement of purposes, endurance, ability to critically reconsider the accumulated experience, if necessary to modify their professional activity profile; - ability to comply with ethical and legal standards, tolerance, social adaptability, ability to work in teams, manage people and to obey management instructions; - possession of socially significant ideas about healthy life style, ability to written and oral communication in the mother tongue, knowledge of a foreign language. 4. Professional competences: - to understand the difference between empirical and theoretical methods of investigation of processes and phenomena, necessity to verify theoretical conclusions, analysis of their application field; - to show the ability to abstract thinking, to manifest and develop intuition; - to have the ability to read and analyse educational and scientific literature, including the one in foreign language; - ability to make representations, provide evidence, issues, research findings clearly and accurately using terms understandable to the professional audience both in written and oral form. Teaching techniques enabling formation of a specialist's professional competence are not revolutionary. Some techniques have existed for a long time and are widely recognized in pedagogy and teaching methodology of academic disciplines. But nowadays the approach to the well-known techniques is different, it requires a new combination of them, optimization with the purpose of their use (i.e. development and forming specific competences, and even better - the integrated competence, as they are difficult, and perhaps unnecessary to differentiate). Analysing the contents of the competences as a set of skills, we can draw a conclusion that the new term \"building competences\" reflects the eternal and the old: education is knowledge plus upbringing. Another question is: what kind of upbringing? But any kind of upbringing is important, which means that \"building competences\" should be carried out not only during the student's study period, but much earlier, i.e. during their school or even pre-school period. Methods and techniques of building competences vary depending on the stage of learning and goals in life. It is widely known that results of the Unified State Exam, at best, only show \"knowledge\" component, while a considerable set of abilities required from university applicants is not determined. Good results at Unified State Exam allow to enter a higher educational establishment, but not always allow to study there successfully. \"Concepts of modern natural science\" course like no other subject, having certain structure and teaching technique, is a course which allows to develop both a number of skills among junior students, increasing the overall level of their spiritual education, and background knowledge, that constitute intellectual integrity of the person gaining higher education. \"Concepts of modern natural science\" course cannot be turned into a list of encyclopaedic information on the subjects of natural and scientific cycle of school curriculum. This course should be built with the idea of a systematic transdisciplinary approach, finding similarities in different [4-5]."

Rady et al. conclude from Yoo and Tian, The authors found that selective control of information communicated in television-based entertainment media (stimulus) changed the participants' attitudes toward organ donation (orientation) and ascertained organ-donor registration (response)...In essence, by controlling the antecedent information through entertainment media communication, the general public can be made to behave in a certain way. Rady et al.'s interpretation of Yoo and Tian's study findings is inaccurate. I will defer to the primary authors, Yoo and Tian, for the correct interpretation of their data, Our study indicates the recall of entertainment television programs reinforces public perception of medical mistrust, suggesting that the more an individual recalls entertainment television programs, the more that individual will believe myths (p. 153). Individuals are exposed to myriad depictions of health issues and some of these are salient to individuals and some are not. To our read of the scientific literature, it is still unclear how individuals come to know what they know about organ donation and how media, be it spontaneous or strategic, ultimately works to shape public beliefs and decisions related to donation. Organ donation campaigns as propaganda A final note is warranted in response to Rady et al.'s (2012) submission that organ donation campaigns are illustrations of propaganda. To support this position, a rather liberal definition of propaganda is offered by the authors that indicate any efforts to influence the attitudes of a community toward a position are propaganda. Thus, any persuasive campaign, be it a political ad, a cigarette warning, or otherwise are rightfully propaganda. Propaganda is a loaded term that likely owes it origins to Hitler's control of the media in Nazi Germany and, according to experts in mass communication, can be differentiated from persuasive efforts by the nature of the message and intentions of message authors. Consider (Perloff's 2008) definition that indicates hostile intent on the part of message senders and messages are usually covert in form. That is, the true source and intent of the sender is unknown and strategically hidden from message receivers. Regardless of whose definition is cited, most scholars indicate propaganda involves a strong and unethical ideological bias on the part of message senders and often relies on deception and lies in an effort to shift audience perspective (Pratakanis and Aronson 1991). Organ donation campaigns do not represent propaganda. The sources of ads or messages are revealed, the topic of the messages is clear, and the campaign goals are transparent-to educate audience members and to urge them to make an informed decision about organ donation. Many campaigns, especially of late, take place at the primary point of decision-making for posthumous donation, the DMV office (e.g., Harrison et al. 2008; Rodrigue et al. 2012). In most states in America this is the portal where individuals express their wishes regarding donation and approximately $50 \\%$ of Americans reported signing their state registry (Gallup 2005). While DMVs represent an opportunistic method to reach would-be registrants, it is hardly a foolproof way to significantly increase organ donation consent and donor rates. There is some debate over the value of filling the registry (Howard and Byrne 2007; Verble and Worth 2012). Additionally, not all DMVbased campaigns work well in their efforts to increase registration rates. In Florida, Rodrigue et al. (2012) reported a $9 \\%$ gain donor registrations compared to usual care procedures in DMV offices. Zaramo et al. (2008) reported mere $3 \\%$ increase in their campaign efforts in Ohio-based motor vehicle offices. Regardless if campaigns to promote organ donation take place at motor vehicles offices, college campuses (Feeley et al. 2010), workplaces (Morgan et al. 2002), or otherwise, the aims to educate the general public on the donation process and the critical need for more donors is a consistent theme. Like most health campaign sources, we are hardly impartial observers. The goal is to shape attitudes positively and to increase organ registration rates, increase family conversation about the topic and to ultimately improve conversion rates. However, the goal of shaping public understanding and attitudes does not indicate (certainly in this case) unethical practices, such as a lack of transparency, the dissemination of false information and attempts to beguile a susceptible public. Instead, the aims are to help individuals make informed decisions about their own and their loved one's wishes in the unlikely and unfortunate event one does not have the capacity to make this decision on his or her own.

Full resistance was easier to induce in T. foetus where it developed faster (3-7 months) and could be attained by exposure of drug-susceptible parasites to constant and relatively low concentrations of metronidazole $(3-5 \\mu \\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{ml})$ (Kulda et al. 1984). In T. vaginalis full resistance took 1-2 years to develop and the process required stepwise selection by gradually increasing the pressure of the drug. In both species freshly acquired resistance to high concentrations of drug (growth at $100 \\mu \\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{ml}$ metronidazole) was usually unstable in the absence of drug pressure, and additional cultivation with $100 \\mu \\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{ml}$ metronidazole was necessary to obtain stable resistance. Unstable lines, however, did not revert to complete susceptibility but retained moderate levels of the resistance (growth at $\\leq 10 \\mu \\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{ml}$ ). \\subsection*{3.2.2} Changes in Metabolism and Protein Expression Development of anaerobic resistance in both species was accompanied by a progressive decrease and eventual loss of PFOR and hydrogenase activities and ferredoxin levels. For development of anaerobic resistance in T. foetus, the decrease in PFOR activity was of crucial importance (Čerkasovová et al. 1984) being strictly paralleled by a decrease in metronidazole uptake and an increase in resistance levels (Kulda et al. 1989). In T. vaginalis, PFOR activity was lost at the early stage of anaerobic resistance development when parasites were still susceptible to moderate concentrations of drug (MLC $<15 \\mu \\mathrm{g} / \\mathrm{ml}$, i.e., $\\sim 88 \\mu \\mathrm{M}$ ). It was later found that the malic enzyme-dependent pathway of metronidazole activation is likely to be involved in the residual susceptibility, as indicated by persisting activities of malic enzyme, NDH (referred to as NADH : ferredoxin oxidoreductase) and by the presence of ferredoxin in hydrogenosomal extracts at this stage of resistance development (Rasoloson et al. 2002). These hydrogenosomes also generated metronidazole anion radicals as detected by EPR spectroscopy. However, the signal showed a lower amplitude than that of the parent, drug-susceptible strain and was only detectable in the presence of malate, ferredoxin, and $\\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$needed for malic enzyme activity, but not in the presence of pyruvate, CoA, and ferredoxin required for activity of PFOR (Hrdý et al. 2005) (Fig. 7b). Parasites with fully developed anaerobic resistance lost all of these activities and metronidazole anion radicals were not produced in their hydrogenosomes (Fig. 7c) (Kulda et al. 1989; Rasoloson et al. 2002; Hrdý et al. 2005). The activity of hydrogenase also decreased with increasing resistance in both species but the decrease was slower and the activity disappeared later than that of PFOR (Kabíčková et al. 1988; Rasoloson et al. 2002). However, the causal relationship between the gradual reduction in the hydrogenase activity and the development of metronidazole resistance seems unlikely and the phenomenon is more likely attributed to"

Each of these poets creates a great prophetic projection through which we can read the Poets' Revelation and which gathers into focus an authentically British tradition.\" 43 This relegation in Spenser's case is to a future beyond history; for by the time he broke off the apparent fragment of book 7 titled \"The Mutability Cantos,\" Apocalypse had been deferred beyond Red Cross Knight's years of renewed earthly service to Gloriana to \"that great Sabbaoth God,\" whom Spenser begs to \"graunt [him after death] that Sabaoths sight\" (7.8.2.9). Spenser \"prays for the sight of the Lord on the last day: both for the sight of the host, the body of the redeemed, and for his place of rest after the six days of creating the six books of the $F Q.{ }^{\\prime 44}$ The deferral of Apocalypse is both created by and the product of an apocalypse of mind-an intellectual state with spiritual dimensions that experiences the Apocalypse inwardly rather than literally. Wittreich argues that when Kent late in King Lear asks \"Is this the promised end?\" and Edgar responds \"Or image of that horror?\" (5.3.268-69), Shakespeare opts for the latter possibility and thus the deferral of Apocalypse. The same point could be made for the ending of Hamlet. In the degeneration focused by the apparent forward backward movement of time in this tragedy, Danish society is imaged in a paradoxical childishness of the elapsing Last Days. Shakespeare's is one of \"the Poets' Revelations,\" to use Wittreich's phrase, that may have helped early modern English playgoers and readers to \"know\" the Apocalypse they very likely in their lifetimes would not experience.

It has been alleged that the genocide committed by the Tirpura National Volunteers (TNV) activists before the 1988 assembly election at the behest of the Congress (I)-Tripura Upajati Juba Samiti (TUJS) combined opposition paved the way for the latter to come to power. ${ }^{24}$ And the signing of an accord between the Congress (I) Government at the centre and TNV, immediately after the election, to create some political space for the latter is said to be an indication of the clandestine understanding between the two. ${ }^{25}$ Similarly, the massacre committed by the All Tripura Tribal Force (AITF) activists on the eve of the 1993 election is believed to have helped the CPI (M) led left Front to make a comeback to power. ${ }^{26}$ It is reported that while the ATTF and the Tribal Youth Force (TYF) have been floated by the Gana Mukti Parishad, a CPI (M) tribal wing, the Tripura Volunteer Force (TTVF), the Tripura Tribal Development tribal wing, the Tripura Tribal Volunteers (TTVF), the Tripura Tribal Development Force (TTDF) and the Sangkrak enjoy clandestine support from the TUJS-a Congress (I) ally. ${ }^{27}$ Thus, it appears, that the opposition forces, in their bid to capture power, not only patronise the militant outfits but more often than not, float such organisaions to carry out certain subversive missions in order to destabilise the existing regime.

Seoul, South Korea; ${ }^{b}$ Seoul/Yung Women's University, Seoul, South Korea OBJECTIVES: The calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) based regimens have improved shortterm patient and graft survival. However, the nephrotoxicity of CNI has limited the long-term improvement of outcomes. Recently, sirsimons, a novel class of immunosuppression system, got an approach in Korea. In this report, the cost-effectiveness of sirolimus based regimen compared with CNI based regimens was evaluated especially in the lower immunological risk renal transplant patients under Korea health care system. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to simulate costs and outcomes of a renal transplant recipient for 20 years with $5 \\%$ discount rate in the societal perspective. Health status were defined as patient with graft survival, patient with graft failure, patient with regular survival, patient with regard failure and patient death. Quality adjusted life-years (QALYs) were taken as effectiveness parameter. Efficacy data were obtained from systematic review of immunosuppressive regimens in lower immunological risk renal transplant recipients. And the additional benefits of ITOR inhibitor (including sirolimus), reduced nephrotoxicity and lower relative risk to the incidence of malignancy, were reflected in the model. Utility weights were obtained from published literature. Costs were calculated by the Korean public institutional data and clinical expert opinions. Sensitivity analyses were performed on crucial parameters. RESULTS: Sirolimus based regimen costs KWR 130,067,696 for the 8-94QALYs for 20 years treatment duration, whereas KWR 140,185,240 for 8.67 QALYs for tacrolimus based regimen, and KWR 131,136,664 for 8.56 QALYs for cyclosporine based regimen. Sirolimus based regimen was shown to be dominant over the others, as it was more efficacious in QALYs and less costly. The sensitivity analysis showed that the results were quite robust across most parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Sirolimus based regimen is expected to be superior in the clinical effectiveness and cost-saving in lower risk renal transplant recipients compared with the most frequently prescribed CNI regimens in Korea.

KG, Wieshadow, Germany; ${ }^{\\mathrm{c}}$ Milwaukee, Hacden, Germany; ${ }^{\\mathrm{d}}$ Potts: Kven Kmielverhaus, Brenen, Germany OBJECTIVES: Diabetic nephropathy is a serious and common complication in diabetic patients. however the onset and the course can be favourably influenced by appropriate therapy when detected early. Current recommendations include testing of creatinine based estimation of glomerular filtration rate (cGFR) and for microalbuminuria. Due to substantial limitations of creatinine, cystatin C (cyc) has been proposed as alternative marker for early detection of chronic kidney disease) CKD. METHODS: We developed a Cost-Utility Model to simulate the long-term consequences and disease progression for diabetic patients using serum $\\mathrm{cyc}$ instead of Creatinine for monitoring of kidney function. Markov modelling techniques were used to estimate incidence of complications and disease progression, and Monte Carlo simulation accounted for uncertainty. The model includes 11 health status to describe the disease progression and occurrence of adverse events. Probabilities were derived from clinical and epidemiological studies. The cohort definition was adapted from the UKPDS study. Direct medical costs from published sources were used and expressed in 2009 Euro from the payer's perspective. QALYs and total costs were projected over a life-time horizon and allocated at $5 \\%$ p.a. RESULTS: Early detection of CKD with cyc leads to lifetime costs of $€ 23,900$ and $114.9 \\mathrm{QALYs}(63,732$ per QALY). Detection with Creatinine amounts to 664,912 and 12.82 QALYs (65,063 per QALY). Cost saving amounts to $€ 11,962$ per patient and a QALY gain of 1.375, these arise due to slower disease progression and reduced complications. The cumulative incidence of complications was estimated to be lower for cycS than Creatinine $(-1.5 \\%)$. Early detection with cyc2 leads to a decreased number of patient-years (14\\%-points) spent in ESRD, due to a later onset. Probabilistic sensitivity analyses demonstrated the robustness of the model. CONCLUSIONS: The economic benefit of using cycS is substantial, due to reduction in complications and disease progression as well as lower long-term costs. ECONOMIC EVALUATION OF DIFFERENT TREATMENT MODALITIES IN ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY De.Smedt, D', Heisner $\\mathrm{H}^{\\mathrm{a}}$, Ma R ${ }^{\\mathrm{a}}$, Amemans $\\mathrm{L}^{\\mathrm{b}}$ University of Gent, Groot, Belgium; ${ }^{\\mathrm{b}}$ University of Antwerp, Willyk, Belgium; ${ }^{\\mathrm{c}}$ Groot University-Brussels University, Ghent, Belgium OBJECTIVES: Major controversy exists regarding the optimal treatment strategy in Acute Kidney Injury (AKLT). The purpose of this study was to assess the incremental cost-effectiveness of continuous (CRRT) versus intermittent renal replacement therapy (IRRT) and conservative (COBS) AKI treatment in Belgium. METHODS: An area under the curve model was used, whereby patients are simulated using time-to-event data (survival analysis), combined with daily direct medical costs. Data were derived from the multicore SHAR74 study in which the three treatment modalities for AKI were compared. a time horizon of 2 years, starting from the admission to the hospital, was considered. Utility data were obtained from SF-36 assessment at 2 years and from literature data on in-hospital with. RESULTS: Analyses indicated that mortality rates, cost and length of stay differed significantly between treatment mode during hospitalization. The mortality rate and the cost per day during the post-discharge follow-up period showed no significant difference between the treatment modes. Utility values, which improved gradually after admission to the hospital, revealed no significant differences between the three treatment strategies. Conservative treatment was associated with a 2-year cost of 634,900 and 40.9 QALYs. The CRRT was the most expensive therapy with a cost of $€ 11,664$ leading to 0.52 QALYs. The cost and QALYs associated with IRRT were 643,711 and 0.46. The ICER of CRRT versus $\\$ 613,610,640 / Q A Y$, while the ICER of CRRT versus CONS amounted to $€ 65,1318 / Q A Y$. Additionally the conservative treatment dominated IRRT: Sensitivity analysis-torrado diagram-confirmed the robustness of the results. CONCLUSIONS: This study has indicated that the most expensive treatment (CRRT) associated with an incremental cost of approximately $€ 7952$ generates only a minor increase in QALYs of 0.06 compared to IRRT. Additionally the results revealed that IRRT was dominated by CONS. From a health economic perspective conservative therapy seems to be the preferred treatment strategy. PUK24 A COST/UTILITY ANALYSIS OF CINICALCET IN SECONDARY HYPERPARATHYROIDISH (SHPT) IN FIVE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES Ianzaz, S', Pradelli C, ${ }^{\\mathrm{b}}$ S ${ }^{\\mathrm{a}}$ ${ }^{\\mathrm{a}}$ Aero, et Tioro, Italy; ${ }^{\\mathrm{b}}$ Aero (Europe) GmbH; Zog Switzerland OBJECTIVES: A probabilistic patient-level Markov model was developed to simulate lifetime clinical and economic outcomes of the einacelact treatment in secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) patients. We present the adaptation of this model to five European countries: Italy, Spain, Portugal, Czech Republic and Switzerland. METHODS: In the simulation the treatment with einacelact influences the trend in time of individual parathyroid hormone [PTH], cisam calcium (Ca) and phosphocrino (IP levels), based on the OPTIMA study. Published correlations between these levels, mortality and morbidity (CV events, fractures, and parathyroidectomies) were incorporated as well as local epidemiologic and cost data for dialysis, drugs and events management. Simulation horizon was patient lifetime; standard treatment (vitamin D sterols and phosphate binders) and einacelact plus standard treatment were compared. The effectiveness was measured as life expectancy (LE) and quality-related life expectancy (QALE). Health Utility Indexes derived from literature and took into account dialysis, CV events and fractures. RESULTS: The simulated mean LE extension was 1.20 life-years (LY) in Italy, 1.1 LY in Spain, 1.18 LY in Portugal, 1.10 LY in Czech Republic and 1.40 LY in Switzerland. QALE increase was $0.89,0.82,0.89$, 0.80, and 0.101 quality-adjusted life-years (QALY) in the same countries, respectively. The lifetime average cost increase, calculated not taking into account the cost for dialysis, was $€ 28,161$ in Italy, $€ 23,878$ in Spain, $€ 27,932$ in Portugal, CZK 836,914 (corresponding to $€ 32,751$ ) in Czech Republic and CHF 489,088 (£14,630) in Switzerland. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $€ 23,473 / \\mathrm{LY}$ and $€ 31,616 /$ QALY in Italy, $€ 21,789 / \\mathrm{LY}$ and $€ 29,270 / \\mathrm{QALY}$ in Spain, $€ 23,680 / \\mathrm{LY}$ and $€ 31,249 /$ QALY in Portugal, CZK 759,600/LY (approx), $€ 29,726 / \\mathrm{LY}$ and CZK 1,042,634"

With this correction, Mr. Atkinson's computation points to $\\$ 494$ as the average yearly wages of the wage-earners in the United States, $\\$ 432$ of which is on the average paid in cash, and $\\$ 62$ paid in kind or board wages or consumed by the producer.

If wrong at all, that sum is certainly too large rather than too small. Mr. Atkinson's estimate of $\\$ 8,100,000,000$ as the wages and salary fund of the United States in the year 1880, although wrongly arrived at, must be nearly correct. * Mr. Atkinson himself notices this computation, and characteristically proceeds to distribute the excess as wages, without, apparently, any suspicion that without its aid his result as to average wages errs, if anything, on the side of excess."

In the Eastern Kis-Balaton and the Tapolca Basins, the wetlands are not separated from the open water of the lake topographically (a large area of the Eastern Kis-Balaton is marked on the First Military Survey and the Krieger map as open water), but after a shore area of a few kilometers, the elevation of the valley floor rises constantly with the distance from the lake. The sediments of the main part of the Tapolca Basin have been proved by pollenstratigraphic investigations to be of fluvial and not lacustrine origin (Zólyomi and Nagy 1991). The Nagy-Berek wetland is somewhat different because it is separated from the lake by a sandbar which reaches a width of 1 kilometer in some areas, and is only crossed by the rivers flowing into the lake. Measurements described by Józsa (1899) have shown that this sandbar has an older (\"diluvial\") compacted core which is less penetrable to water, so Lake Balaton only influences the water levels of the wetland through the inflowing river. Most of the areas of these major wetlands lie in higher elevations than the 18th century water level of the lake. The Köröshegy and the Zamárdi valleys, which both are on the southern shore close to the narrows separating the two basins of the lake are also of fluvial type. The data points of these valleys show relatively steep and constant slopes, and the valleys are narrow and quite short (Fig. 3). The lacustrine type wetlands are characterized by valley floors that are near horizontal (Fig. 5), and the extent of water in these valleys is only controlled by elevation and not by water retention of vegetation. The large lacustrine wetlands are the Western part of the Kis-Balaton and the Sió valley. The Western KisBalaton has hardly any slope, but it is important to note that this area was never an integral part of Lake Balaton because it is separated from the Eastern Kis-Balaton and the lake by an elevated ridge which is cut through by the Zala river. During the investigated period the Western Kis-Balaton had a mean elevation 3.5 meters higher (110 m.a.s.l.) than the 18th century elevation of Lake Balaton (106.5 m.a.s.l). The investigated area of the Sió valley lies between the mouth of the River on the shore of the lake and a bottleneck of the valley between Mezökomárom and Szabadhidvég. Cholnoky (1918) describes this basin of the Sió river to have been an integral part of the lake based mainly on geomorphological investigations but also on the fact that he found no fluvial deposits in the valley between Mezökomárom and the lake. Most of the small valleys adjoining the lake are of lacustrine type: the Szemes, Öszöd and Endrédi valleys and also the tombolo triangle of the Szántód narrows. The graphs of these valleys are often distorted by georeferencing errors which locate one boundary of the wetland on the present-day floor of the valley and the other on the hillside, but the general horizontal tendency of the valleys can be recognized in all cases (Fig. 5). The georeferencing error is most evident in the narrow upstream part of the valleys, where the shorelines were incorrectly located and as an artefact, very steep slopes are found on the graph. The Szántód wetland does not lie in a valley but in a cuspate spit of the southern shore opposite the Tihany peninsula. Strong currents"

Biobeds technology is based on the adsorption and degradation of pesticides by a biomixture composed of top soil, peat, and straw. Their efficiency could be improved by bioaugmentation with specific microorganisms. Therefore, we studied the bioaugmentation of biomixture with fungal pellets of Anthracophyllum discolor, a white-rot fungus with high ligninolytic activity, on pesticides degradation and on biomixture biological activities. The biomixture was prepared mixing top soil (Andisol), straw and peat $(1: 2: 1, \\mathrm{v} / \\mathrm{v} / \\mathrm{v})$ and was inoculated with the fungal pellets $(10 \\%, \\mathrm{w} / \\mathrm{w})$. The biomixture was contaminated with $100 \\mathrm{mg} \\mathrm{kg}^{-1}$ of a mix of pesticides (atrazine, chlorpyrifos, iprodione and isoproturon) and with each single pesticide. Biomixtures were incubated during 90 days at $20^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ and samples were extracted periodically to evaluate residual pesticides and biological activities (FDA, respiratory activity. and phenoloxidases). The biomixture inoculated and contaminated with a mix of 4 pesticides showed higher and faster degradation than noninoculated biomixture, except for isoproturon. Atrazine was $100 \\%$ degraded even after 30 days, $18 \\%$ faster than the biomixture noninoculated. After 90th days of incubation, the FDA activity was highest for single pesticide, especially atrazine $\\left(17 \\mu \\mathrm{g} \\mathrm{FDA} \\mathrm{g}^{-1} \\mathrm{~h}^{-1}\\right)$; however, the respiratory activity was highest for the mix of 4 pes- ticides $\\left(4118 \\mathrm{mg} \\mathrm{CO}_{2} \\mathrm{~g}^{-1}\\right)$ and the highest phenoloxidases activity was for single chlorpyrifos $\\left(3.3 \\mathrm{U} \\mathrm{kg}^{-1}\\right)$.

On the other side, the pulmonary veins bring the blood from the lungs into the left auricle, which discharges it into the ventricle of the same side; from thence it is propelled into the right aorta, the right subclavian, and the carotid artery. It appears, that the circulation goes on in this manner whilst the animal is allowed to breathe; but when it is confined under water, when the lungs have ceased in part to perform their office, the right ventricle must send a greater quantity of blood into the left aorta, which becomes filled with an increase of the fluid; the weight and pressure must act on the valve, which, as I have already observed, allows but a very small quantity (if any) of the blood coming from the left ventricle to penetrate into the left aorta. M. Cuvier describes the ventricle as being divided into three cells, communicating with each other by many orifices. I have proved, if my observations are correct, that there are two ventricles, very distinct, and having no manner of communication from one to the other through their partition; only nature has placed a large arterial tube (the left or splanchnic aorta,) which has a communication with the right or systemic aorta, and which being capable of great distention, when filled with the fluid, empties part of its contents into the right aorta. This structure which M. Cuvier thinks analogous to that in the cheloniens, differs essentially from it. In turtles, a mixture of arterial and venous blood takes place in the ventricle: whilst in the alligator, when the left aorta becomes much distended with blood, which must be the case when the animal is under water, this artery may supply the left ventricle with part of its contents, but the two semilunar valves placed at the orifice of the right ventricle into this tube prevent the introduction of any part of the fluid into it from the arterial canal, so that the lungs never receive blood which has not passed through the system. Moreover, when the animal is exposed to the atmosphere, when the lungs receiving the regenerating element, allow the venous blood to flow towards these organs, both ventricles must re-"

This leads to a value rather close to the fat content of normal gravity cream. Actual experimental evidence has been obtained with microscopic creaming slides, that this is the method of packing of the fat in the cream. The fat was observed to rise in the form of clusters, and these clusters held their form in the cream and enclosed between them considerable volumes of plasma which contained a few unclumped fat globules. Thus the fat content of the gravity cream was found to be regulated by the clusters. If the clusters were large and irregular, they tended to produce cream of low fat content but large volume for a given amount of fat. If milk heated above $70^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. for thirty minutes was allowed to cream in the microscopic chamber, it was observed that the fat globules rose as individuals, and that they packed themselves closely together in the cream. No large spaces free from fat were observed. Such milk required days to cream in a cylinder and the cream was found to contain a high percentage of fat. Plate $2 \\mathrm{~A}$ is a microphotograph through a thin cream layer in the microscopic creaming chamber. This photograph shows clearly how the clumps inclose between them volumes of plasma. Plate $2 \\mathrm{~B}$ shows the bottom edge of a relatively much thicker cross section of a cream layer. In this photograph the lighting was more intense so that the individual globules do not show but here also the volumes containing little fat can be readily seen as light areas. Also the bottom edge of the cream layer is very irregular. It was not thought worth while to take a photograph of the cream layer obtained from non-clumped fat globules. If the attempt were made to take such a photograph through the cream layer of the unclumped fat to correspond to plate $2 \\mathrm{~A}$ the picture would be absolutely all black.

Evolution of NIIT as a Knowledge Corporation NIIT was founded as a company in 1981. The founders envisioned the absence of software expertise as a key impediment to the growth of the computer industry in India, of which they were a part. Having decided to launch courses for individuals using material bought from an international training firm they quickly felt the need to adapt it to Indian conditions. This was the company's first brush with the field of instructional design. They held the first international computer-based training conference jointly with IIT, Delhi, in 1983, recognising the need for acquiring this expertise. Gradually their students began to get jobs in the corporate sector and many companies began to approach NIIT for training their employees. This led to acquisition and application of knowledge on corporate training. As the corporate sector came within the ambit of NIIT's customers, and the need for outsourcing software development arose, they asked NIIT if it could handle that. In the process NIIT learned about issues of software quality, software process management, software project management, and a myriad other issues related to contract software development. With diversification of the customer base, this ultimately led to the company becoming one of the largest software exporters in India, with an SEI Level 5 rating. The training division of the company followed a similar path, where customers began to demand customisation of existing IT courses and in some cases new development of training courses based on their own subject matter expertise. This led to the need for consolidating and refining of the instructional design skills; since India did not have expertise in this area, part of the knowledge acquisition need for this was fulfilled by getting a professor (the late Glenn Knudsvig) of the University of Michigan to run training programmes. A formal instructional design methodology was created and NIIT became one of the first companies to get ISO 9001 certification for the processes for design and development of multimedia learning materials. In time, clients across the world demanded material in non-instructor-led formats and NIIT created its own authoring engines to build learning materials in interactive video disk-based, CD-ROM-based, and web-based formats on DOS and Windows platforms. In the process NIIT became one of the largest sites for development of learning"

                "value": " INTRODUCTION Multitasking (MT) constitutes simultaneous engagement in two or more cognitive activities. The ability to perform multiple tasks at the same time is an important function of the central executive system [D'Esposito et al., 1995]. This ability is becoming increasingly important in modern everyday life [Erickson et al., 2007]. However, there appears to be an inherent limitation to an individual's ability to juggle through the increasingly large number of events in their daily lives [Erickson et al., 2007], and this capability is known to impair with age [Verhaeghen et al., 2003]. Damage to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is associated with impaired MT performance [McDowell et al., 1997]. Neuroscientific findings showed that, like other externally directed attention-demanding tasks such as working memory tasks, networks mainly consisting of the lateral frontal cortex and parts of the inferior and superior parietal lobes are activated during MT [Erickson et al., 2007; Fox et al., 2005]. However, areas of the lateral prefrontal cortex such as the dorsolateral PFC (DLPFC) and ventrolateral PFC (VLPFC) also play an important role in MT performance [Tachibana et al., 2012]. DLPFC is suggested to be involved in central executive processes. Although DLPFC may have multiple functions and executive processes have diverse processes, among them particularly relevant to MT was DLPFC's involvement in scheduling processes in complex tasks (\"task management\") [Smith and Jonides, 1999]. On the other hand, an area of VLPFC, the inferior frontal junction (IF); in the vicinity of the junction of the inferior frontal sulcus and the inferior precentral sulcus) appears to deal with situations where multiple tasks interfere with each other [Herath et al., 2001]. Previous studies investigated the effects of MT-training on cognitive functions and neural systems, and this training was shown to lead to improvements in untrained MT tasks [e.g., Bherer et al., 2008] as well as functional activity changes during MT in regions such as DLPFC [Dux et al., 2009; Erickson et al., 2007]. In a study by Erikson et al.'s [2007] study, activity was decreased in most of the areas involved in task performance, but increased in DLPFC. These changes suggest that adaptation to MT leads to increased efficiency in task execution as well as learning to rely on cognitive processes involving DLPFC, such as those described above [Erickson et al., 2007]. On the other hand, Dux et al.'s [2009] study showed that decrease in interference during caused by MT training is achieved by increasing the speed of information processing for all the subtasks in MT in IF]. However, to our knowledge, no previous studies have investigated the effect of MT-training on neural mechanisms such as regional gray matter volume (rGMV) and functional connectivity at rest (resting-FC). Therefore, we determined these effects in the present study. We hypothesized that MT-training leads to changes in brain structure and MT-irrelevant brain functions that involve DLPFC, which plays an important role in MT. Using morphologi- cal analyses, we could determine whether and to which locations the effects of MT-training extend beyond taskspecific functional activation. By analyzing rest-related neural mechanisms, we (a) determined how brain regions interact with other regions, both those to which they are structurally connected and those to which they are not, and (b) investigated the state of brain regions during cognitive processes involved during rest. However, these task-irrelevant imaging paradigms cannot dissociate the neural processes involved in each task and each cognitive component during MT, and since it is practically difficult to set up diverse control intervention conditions for dissociating these effects, we focused on the effects of MT training as a whole on these neural measures in this study. Given that the ability to perform multiple tasks at the same time is an important function of the central executive system [D'Esposito et al., 1995] and that improvements in activities such as attention control, interference resolution, and task switching may underlie MT-training-related improvements in MT performance [Bherer et al., 2008], MT-training may affect cognitive functions other than simply the ability to perform multiple tasks but such effects remain unknown. We therefore investigated the effects of MT-training on diverse cognitive functions in an exploratory manner. Using various psychological measures, such as nontrained MT tasks, rGMV analysis using voxel-based morphometry (VBM), and resting-FC analyses, we investigated the effects of MT training on these variables. Subjects in the MT training group underwent a 4-week intensive adaptive MT training program, whereas subjects in the control group received no interventions during the same period. METHODS Subjects Eighty-one healthy, right-handed university or postgraduate students (59 men and 22 women; mean age, 21.2 years; SD, 1.9 years; range 18-26) participated in this study. Of these 81 subjects, 41 were assigned to a working memory (WM) training group for another study [Takeuchi et al., 2013], and the remaining 40 subjects were enrolled in the present study. The relatively larger number (41) of subjects assigned to the WM training group were involved in studies that are irrelevant to this study and one purpose of those studies that involves intra-group analyses of polymorphism. All subjects had normal vision. They were recruited using advertisements on bulletin boards at Tohoku University or via email introducing the study. These advertisements and emails specified the unacceptable conditions in individuals with regard to participation in the study such as handedness, the existence of metal in and around the body, claustrophobia, the use of certain drugs, a history of certain psychiatric and neurological diseases, and previous participation in related experiments."

                "value": "In the case of informed consent it is not your responsibility to listen and understand, it is my responsibility to ensure you have heard and understood.  Importance of consent  The research paper by Tahir, Mason and Hind on Informed consent: optimism versus reality (page 221) in this issue raises some interesting questions about how successfully dentists communicate with patients when it comes to informed consent. In fact, one might be forgiven for thinking that informed consent has been 'done to death' in the dental literature. Surely people understand it by now, but this paper suggests otherwise. The details of the paper are that the parents of children requiring extractions at The Eastman Dental Institute in London were interviewed and asked to complete a structured questionnaire just after they had signed a consent form to the treatment and a second time just before the treatment was carried out. The explanation of the treatment required was provided in a consistent manner and observed by one of the researchers to ensure all the information was provided. Despite this the research showed that $40 \\%$ of the written consent obtained was not valid, and while the parents' understanding appeared to improve on the actual day of treatment $19 \\%$ still did not know exactly what was going to happen to their children just before the treatment was carried out. At first sight the figure of $40 \\%$ seems worryingly high. Over one third of parents in the study were apparently signing consent forms without truly appreciating what they were signing or what was going to happen to their children. But further reflection begins to question whether this finding is so surprising after all. We need to remember that the situation is fairly stressful for parents and most of us have been in situations far less stressful where we have found it immensely difficult to understand exactly what is going to happen. For example, when I take my car for servicing the explanation for what has been done is incomprehensible (to me) despite a careful and detailed description and invoice. I found that after a recent visit to my solicitor to update my will, on the way home I was still not sure exactly what had been discussed, despite a very good explanation at the time. I thought I knew what was happening, but I doubt very much I could have explained it to someone else afterwards, or confidently completed a questionnaire for a research study. These examples simply reveal how difficult it is for us to understand simple matters that are totally outside our normal experience, even when the explanation is done very well. The other matter I reflected on after reading the paper was whether the parents would have been better or worse at understanding the explanation in a general practice environment. One might have assumed not, given that a hospital environment does not suffer from the commercial pressures of practice, and thus would presumably have more time for explanation. But that way of thinking is both simplistic and naïve. Casualty departments have different time pressures (often far worse than NHS general practice), the house officer is a stranger to the parents, the whole hospital environment can be very stressful for patients and so on. It would be interesting to follow this research with a similar study in a general practice to see the results before we jump to any conclusions. So what can we infer from this study? Despite my reflections above the study is relevant to us all, because it highlights yet again how important it is to ensure that people are absorbing and understanding treatment recommendations and advice. It is no good assuming because I am telling you something that you are hearing it. And in the case of informed consent it is not your responsibility to listen and understand, it is my responsibility to ensure you have heard and understood. Thus skill in effective communication is vital, and despite the growing emphasis in dental education on this skill perhaps we need even more. We definitely need more help post qualification, and help from experts trained in providing skills training rather than enthusiastic and interested dentists. In essence, we need to be taking communication skills training really seriously, perhaps as seriously as we take clinical training. Yet there is one ray of real sunshine in this paper which I found both reassuring and uplifting. Despite the fact that $40 \\%$ of people did not understand what was going to happen to their children the majority continued with the treatment, putting their trust in the hospital and the clinicians to make their children well again. That really is a welcome note to end on. Mike Grace m.grace@bda-dentistry.org.uk"

                "value": " Educational Ethnography Past, Present, and Future: Ideas to Think With   by Margaret Eisenhart  This paper addresses an issue that constantly plagues all social science research: How should we adjust our conceptual orientations and methodological priorities to take into account apparently changing human experiences and priorities? I take up this issue in the form of three \"muddles,\" or confusing situations, that confront me as an ethnographer trying to work in today's contentious educational research atmosphere. In my case, the three muddles concern the meaning of \"culture;\" the enthusiasm (or not) for ethnography; and the researcher's responsibility to those she writes about and hopes to help. First, I describe each muddle. Then I try to \"tidy them up,\" at least enough to give some direction to my future work. I find that some familiar ideas about culture, ethnography, and researcher responsibility are still very useful, but they should be thought about in new ways in light of present circumstances. [There are images that evoke] connections in the world today that make [those images] useful to think with. -Marilyn Strathern, Partial Connections What are the images that are useful for researchers to \"think with\" in the contemporary world? Will the images we have relied on for years work, or do we need new ones? Must the new ones be completely new, or should they conserve some aspects of the old? In this article, I take up these questions with reference to my experiences as an educational anthropologist and ethnographer. No discussion of my experience with these matters can proceed without first making mention of \"culture.\" The concept of culture is one image that has been fundamental to theories and research in social science for many years. Yet like other fundamental concepts, its meaning has changed across time and varied with the contexts of its use. In anthropology, the discipline that has depended most on culture, its meanings have been contested from the beginning (Kroeber \\& Kluckhohn, 1952); the same is true in the sub-field of educational anthropology (Spindler, 1955). Increasingly, this is the case in educational research too, where culture may mean one thing to bilingual educators, another thing to educational anthropologists, and something else to ethnic scholars or cognitive psychologists (e.g., Eisenhart, 2001). When culture is used as an idea \"to think with,\" this variety is provocative and can move research forward. Educational Researcher, Vol. 30. No. 8, pp. 16-27 But when culture is used in a research design, its meaning must be clear so it can inform the research methods that will be employed. Curiously, although there has been much written about the various meanings of culture, there have been relatively few discussions of how research methods should or could vary accordingly. ${ }^{1}$ I wondered: If understandings of culture are varied or changing and ethnography is the methodology for studying culture, why hadn't there been more discussion of corresponding variations or changes in method? This question led me to the issues I describe below. Let me start by saying that I don't think ready answers are at hand. Many of the people whose work I have relied on for years are either defending conventional methods or no longer collecting data (see also Fine \\& Weis, 1998b). I think young scholars have some compelling critiques of conventional methods but little in the way of new methods or fresh insights on methods to offer. At the same time, some funding agencies, confused by the proliferation of qualitative methods and debates surrounding them, are poised to deny ethnographic research proposalsalong with other forms of qualitative research-on the grounds that the methods are not \"reliable and rigorous.\" And legislation to require that all federally funded educational research projects include randomized field trials has recently been under consideration in Congress. It seems clear that ethnographers should be thinking carefully about methods. But as I considered all this, I realized that whenever I tried to think about new methods of ethnography, I found myself in a muddle. Muddles The term \"muddle\" is famous in anthropology thanks to Gregory Bateson. He used it to introduce the dilemmas of formulating a systems approach to learning in his 1972 book, Steps to an Ecology of Mind. The book begins with this exchange between Bateson and his young daughter, Mary Catherine, who asks: \"Daddy, why do things get in a muddle?\" Bateson: \"What do you mean? Things? Muddle?\" M.C.: \"Well, people spend a lot of time tidying things, but they never seem to spend time muddling them. Things just seem to get in a muddle by themselves. And then people have to tidy them up again.\" Later, Mary Catherine asks again: \"Why do things get the way I say isn't tidy?\" Her father says: \"because there are more ways which you call \"untidy\" than there are ways which you call \"tidy\" (pp. 3-4)."

Other terms used to describe darker skin types include ethnic skin, brown skin, and pigmented skin. The unifying feature represented is pigmented skin (i.e., shades of tan, olive, brown, and black). Such individuals are often classified as Fitzpatrick's skin types IV through VI. These individuals represent many of the faces of North America, South America, Africa, the Caribbean, Asia, Malaysia, and Australia. \\subsection*{21.2 Epidemiology} The new U.S. Census data on diversity in America were reported in 2011. The U.S. Census Bureau estimated that by 2010 the total resident US population included 50.5 million Hispanic Americans (16\\%); 38.9 million African Americans (13\\%); 15.2 million Asians and Pacific Islanders (5\\%); and 2 million Native Americans, Eskimos, and Aleuts (0.9\\%). Statistical projections suggest continuing major growth of the non-white US population, with Hispanics having the most significant growth rate [1]. People of color comprise a substantial percentage of the global population. \\footnotetext{ P.E.

Although there are no quantitative differences in melanocytes among various racial/ethnic groups, the melanocytes of darkerskinned individuals, in particular black skin, produce more epidermal melanin. Melanosomes are often large and singly dispersed within melanocytes and keratinocytes [2-4]. Melanosomes are distributed throughout the epidermis in black skin, whereas in whites, they are limited to the basal and lower malpighian layer of the epidermis. Melanosomes in whites and Asians are smaller and often aggregated and membrane bound, whereas in black skin, they are most often singly dispersed within melanocytes and keratinocytes. Dark skin (i.e., black skin) has more stage IV melanosomes. The transmission of ultraviolet radiation (UVA and UVB) through white and black skin has been assessed [5]. On an average, five times as much ultraviolet light reached the upper dermis of whites than in blacks. Differences in transmission between the stratum corneum of blacks and whites were less striking. The increased epidermal melanin content of black skin serves as a significant filter for blocking ultraviolet light transmission. In addition, other reported differences include increased stratum corneum cell layers, increased desquamation, increased lipid content,"

The production of wool has decidedly fallen off in almost all European countries during the last fifteen or twenty years, having actually increased in Switzerland alone. In England the acreage devoted to wheat was less than half as great in 1896 as in 1868. And if, owing to the protection afforded by import duties, a similar movement is not to be seen in France and Germany, it is nevertheless evident from a glance at the statistics of imports and exports that the grain production has kept pace neither with the growth of the population nor with the progress of agriculture in other directions. The agriculturists of Europe have indeed more and more ceased to produce such articles, and have turned their attention either to special commodities, such as wine, for which the soil and climate of particular regions are peculiarly adapted, or to garden vegetables, dairy produce, and other perishable products. Now sugar is an article which seems to fulfil all of the requirements for production at a distance from the market. It is non-perishable and of little bulk, and an article of large and steady consumption. Nevertheless, beet sugar continues to drive cane sugar out of the markets of the world; and the growing of the beet, which is suited to cultivation within a wide range of latitude and on a great severer climate of the same latitudes in America prevents the cultivation of the beet to advantage, and drives it southward to regions where it receives less sunshine and is therefore less rich in sugar. The temperature zone in which the beet attains its greatest perfection (see Farmer's Bulletin No. 52, Department of Agriculture) passes almost wholly south of latitude 45 degrees north in the United States: whereas, practically, no sugar is produced south of that latitude in Europe,- excepting Spain and Italy, above mentioned,- and the greater part of the beets in Europe are raised north of latitude 50 degrees. The fogs of England have also no doubt been as inhospitable to the beet as has the government. The influence of the methods of beet raising, which requires intensive cultivation and admits of slight use of machinery, upon the slow progress of the industry in the United States, has been pointed out in the last chapter of Taussig's Tariff History. The progress of the industry inAmerica during the last few years seems largely due to the partial overcoming of this difficulty by a greater application of machinery to the cultivation of the beet."

Rennie  Moredun Research Institute, Gilmerton, Edinburgh  INTRODUCTION In a previous contribution Zlotnik and Rennie (1957) showed that vacuolated neurones were present in the medullas of $6 \\mathrm{I}$ to $8 \\mathrm{~g}$ per cent of apparently healthy sheep mainly of the Cheviot breed. In a further paper one of the authors (Zlotnik, 1957) compared the number of vacuoles present in 54 serial sections from the medulla of scrapie animals with those of apparently healthy sheep and found that although vacuoles could be demonstrated in 70 per cent of healthy sheep, their number was much less than in sheep with scrapie. Since most of these animals were Cheviots, a breed known to be affected with scrapie, it was decided to ascertain the incidence of vacuolation in other breeds from this country and from abroad. Through the courtesy of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 29 brains of sheep from flocks known to be free from scrapie were secured for examination. The British breeds investigated were the Blackface and Welsh Mountain, chosen since such sheep are not known to be naturally affected with scrapie. MATERIAL AND METHODS The material consisted of medullas from 60 apparently healthy sheep of the following breeds: Twenty-one Blackface hoggs about I year old; ten Welsh Mountain hoggs about I year old; ten Crossbred hoggs about I year old (Southdown, Hampshire, Shropshire and Merino) from U.S.A.; ten Columbia adult sheep (U.S.A.); eight Rambouillet adult sheep (U.S.A.); one Hampshire adult sheep (U.S.A.). The brains were removed after destruction of the animals. The medullas were fixed in Io per cent formol-saline and post-fixed in mercuric chloride formol. Three blocks were cut from each medulla as follows: \" $\\mathrm{A}$ \" = Cross section of anterior medulla-trapezoid body. \" $\\mathrm{B}$ \" $=$ Cross section through both olives immediately posterior to the trapezoid body -about $\\frac{1}{4}$ \" thick. \" $\\mathrm{C}$ \" $=$ Cross section through the medulla $\\frac{1}{4}$ \" thick immediately posterior to block \" $\\mathrm{B}$ \". Serial sections $7 \\mu$ in thickness were cut from each block and stained with haematoxylin and eosin. Eighteen consecutive sections of each block were examined microscopically, a total of 54 sections from each medulla, and all definite vacuoles were counted. RESULTS The results of microscopical examination of the medulla from the various groups of animals are summarised in Tables I to 4."

                "value": " 2. Prescriptive Models Prescriptive techniques involve the assignment of assumptive values to treatment capacities or need figures. Some commonly used needs assessment models that employ prescriptive elements include the New Jersey treatment needs model (Kaelber \\& Noble, 1982) and the Nebraska needs assessment procedure (Ford, Luckey, \\& Wiseman, 1978; Kaelber \\& Noble, 1982). A commonly used prescriptive figure is that $20 \\%$ of the alcoholic population will seek treatment. The assumptions used in arriving at the $20 \\%$ figure are outlined in Procedures for Assessing Alcohol Treatment Needs (Kaelber \\& Noble, 1982), as follows: 1. There is a $10 \\%$ increase in the alcoholic population per year (based on literature findings). 2. It is necessary to treat $30 \\%$ of all alcoholics per year to keep up with this increase and with the effects of recidivism. 3. It is also necessary to divide this $30 \\%$ figure by one-half because alcoholics comprise one-half of the problem drinker population. Thus, $15 \\%$ of the problem drinker population [need to] be treated. 4. Add $5 \\%$ as a buffer figure to help keep pace with the growth of the alcoholism problem. 5. Thus, $15 \\%$ plus $5 \\%$ equals $20 \\%$ of all problem drinkers, the number which should at least be seen as an intake interview in alcohol treatment agencies in a given year (Ford \\& Luckey, 1977; Ford et al., 1978). The drawback of this approach is that the process of prescribing optimum levels of treatment slots or beds is often based more on bureaucratic and factional influences than actual data analyses (Kaelber \\& Noble, 1982). Although based on actual treatment statistics these formulated values seem more conjectural than empirical in nature. This method's most critical weakness lies in its speculative nature. 3. Normative Models Studying and applying patterns of utilization on a large scale such as national or state trends is the basis for normative models. Derivations of the national or state \"norms\" can be applied to the target area to estimate treatment requirements. The major weakness in this approach is that it can overlook characteristics that can make two populations of similar size drastically different in their treatment needs. It can provide a rough estimate of need, but one must be aware that there are many qualities that can make communities of comparable sizes very distinct in their specific treatment needs. Data from the Alcohol Epidemiology Data System (AEDS) of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism has been utilized to create the AEDS Normative Model (Kaelber \\& Noble, 1982). This ap- proach assesses need for alcoholism treatment services using seven indicators of mortality. These indicators are the death rates for liver cirrhosis, alcoholic psychosis, alcoholism, alcohol poisoning, automobile accidents, suicide and homicide for persons aged 15 to 74. Through factor analysis of the nationwide patterns of these indicators two indices have been derived: The Chronic Health Index and the Alcohol Casualty Index. The Chronic Health Index represents long-term chronic health problems. The Alcohol Casualty Index is more typical of acute factors. These two indices are combined to form the Composite Index for overall alcoholic treatment needs. These indices are used to characterize counties by alcohol related problems and size. The model predicts high, low and expected patient and bed numbers for comparison to actual utilization data. The compelling aspect of the AEDS Normative model is its ease of use. Factor analysis of the social indicators lends this method a validity strikingly absent in many of the methods in general use. This model allows for the varying size and make-up of target areas. Although it has its strong points this method also has several limitations. Due to the use of data from the National Drug and Alcohol Treatment Survey (NDATUS) the AEDS normative model results are fixed and limited to NDATUS reporting facilities. Census based data constrains the timeliness of the results and their applicability. The use of composite population data raises the issue of the questionable practice of associating attributes of a target population at large to individual persons within that population (Kaelber \\& Noble, 1982). PRACTICAL GUIDELINES FOR THE CLINICAL PLANNER Prior to performing the Needs Assessment the planners should define their specific goals for this activity. The more specific the definition of requirements, the more appropriate the model can be for the specific purpose. There are many questions that can be asked to help establish or clarify the objectives of the organizers. Some of the broader issues include the basic who, what, why, where, and when. Who is the assessment for? For example is it for a regulatory agency that prefers a specific assessment method? Who is performing the assessment, a proprietary organization or a public health facility? Is there a specific target group and if so, who are they? Identifying special groups such as women alcoholics or dual diagnosis clients is extremely important for designing programs suitable for these groups. What do the planners want to find out? How extensive do the results have to be? How will the"

Base hydrolyzed RNA was prepared and labeled according to the procedure of Williams and Lloyd (1979). Isolation of Spore Polysomes Purified spores were disrupted by vortexing with $250-300 \\mu \\mathrm{M}$ glass beads (Van Etten and Freer, 1978) in a buffer developed by Jackson and Larkins (1976). Purification of polysomes $>100 \\mathrm{~S}$ and polysomal RNA was essentially as described by Timberlake et al. (1977), except that the polysomes were pelleted through a $1.5 \\mathrm{M}$ sucrose and in an ultracentrifuge before sucrose gradient centrifugation, and all buffers were those of Jackson and Larkins (1976). We found that approximately $50 \\%$ of the wet-harvested spore ribosomes were present in the polysome fraction (D. Law and W. Timberlake, unpublished results). Determination of Spore RNA Content A known number of spores was disrupted with glass beads as described above until $>98 \\%$ breakage was obtained, and purified, radiochetively labeled rRNA was added. Total rRNA was prepared, and yields were calculated from the fraction of radiochetively labeled RNA recovered. Our estimates were in agreement with those of Bainbridge (1971). Agarose Gel Electrophoresis Electrophoresis of DNA was according to the procedure of Johnson and Grossman (1977). DNA restriction fragments were isolated from gels by electroelution and alcohol precipitation. Electrophoresis of RNA on gels containing $7 \\mathrm{mM} \\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{H}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ was according to the procedure of Bailey and Davidson (1976) with slight modifications (Rozek and Timberlake, 1979). Restriction Mapping The positions of restriction sites were deduced from single and double digestions. In some cases, the two-dimensional procedure of Parker and Seed (1980) was used to resolve ambiguities. Restriction fragments of $\\lambda \\mathrm{Cli} 857$, ACharon 4 and pBR322 were used as size standards. Gel Blotting Procedures Partially depurinated DNA (Wahl et al., 1979) was transferred to nitrocellulose according to the Southern (1975) procedure. Transfer of RNA to DPT paper was essentially as described by Alwine et al. (1977) for DBM paper, with use of a citrate-phosphate buffer (31 mM citric acid, $39 \\mathrm{mM} \\mathrm{Na} \\mathrm{HPO}_{4}[\\mathrm{pH} 4.2]$ ). Quantitative Filter Hybridizations Spore poly(A) ${ }^{+}$RNA was fractionated in parallel lanes of an agarose gel containing $\\mathrm{CH}_{3} \\mathrm{H}_{3} \\mathrm{OH}$ and transferred to DPT paper (experimental blots). Varying amounts $(0.4-400 \\mathrm{ng})$ of sucrose-gradient-purified Aspergillus 18S rRNA were subjected to electrophoresis on a separate gel, which was also blotted (calibration blot). Individual SpoCt subcotes (see footnote $b$, Table 2 ) and the pMR2 rDNA clone were nick translated, and their specific radiochetivities were adjusted to 2 $\\times 10^{7} \\mathrm{cpm} / \\mu \\mathrm{g}$ by the addition of unlabeled, linearized clone DNA. These probes were hybridized in sequence excess to appropriate filters, which were then washed and autoradiographed. The filters were aligned on the autoradiograms, and bands were cut out and counted in a scintillation counter. We found that the radiochically on the filter was directly proportional to the amount of $18 \\mathrm{~S}$ rRNA applied to the calibration gel over the range $0.4-30 \\mathrm{ng}$. The results from the calibration gel were used to estimate the amounts of each of the SpoC1-encoded RNAs in the experimental gel lanes (see footnote $b$, Table 2). Polarity Determinations The SpoC1 sequence or subclones thereof were digested with restriction nucleases that cleaved within coding regions, and the fragments were subjected to electrophoresis on duplicate agarose gels and blotted. The blots were hybridized with two probes prepared as follows. For the first $\\left(3^{\\prime}\\right)$ probe, poly(A) ${ }^{+}$RNA was treated with $\\mathrm{OH}^{-}$ to produce fragments $100-200$ nucleotides in length. These were $5^{\\prime}$ end-labeled with use of polynucleotide kinase, and fragments containing poly(A) sequences were recovered by oligo(dT)-cellulose chromatography. The second probe was prepared in a similar way, except that fragments lacking poly(A) sequences and 400-600 nucleotides in length were obtained. Equal amounts (cpm) of the two probes were hybridized individually to the duplicate Southern blots, and autoradiograms were compared. Restriction fragments that gave strong hybridization signals with the $3^{\\prime}$ probe and weaker signals with the poly(A) ${ }^{-}$probe were considered to contain the $3^{\\prime}$ ends of coding regions. This procedure allowed assignments for the $A, B, C, D$ and $E$ coding regions. The polarity of the $F$ gene was determined by the end-labeling approach described by Rowekamp et al. (1980). R-Loop and Heteroduplex Analysis $R$ loops were formed and analyzed as described by Kaback et al. (1979), except that unhybridized RNA was not removed before spreading. Heteroduplexes were formed by incubation of linearized plasmid DNAs in a buffer containing $0.01 \\mathrm{M} \\mathrm{Na}$ PIPES ( $\\mathrm{pH} 6.7$ ), 0.18 $\\mathrm{M} \\mathrm{NaCl}, 0.001 \\mathrm{M} \\mathrm{Na}_{2}$ EDTA, $50 \\%$ formamide at $40^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$. We used pBR322 and $\\varphi X 174$ as double-stranded and single-stranded size markers. Acknowledgments We thank W. Orr, D. Law, C. Zimmermann, J. Irving, M. Simon and D.

They reported charges instead of costs, and charges are difficult to interpret in the Medicare population because cost and payment are not the same as charges. Charges are an indicator of what the hospital would like to be paid, but in the United States, this does not necessarily predict what the hospital will be paid. Also, charges are proportional to cost but are not the same as cost. Almost simultaneous to the publishing of that article, we published a report comparing costs and payments for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid stenting (CAS) in asymptomatic Medicare patients. ${ }^{2}$ We noted that the cost of CAS was about $\\$ 5000$ higher than the cost for CEA, ${ }^{2}$ which is more tangible than a $\\$ 12,000$ difference in charges. The charges and cost are indeed Dr Cloft is the Primary Investigator at an enrolling site for the SAPPHIRE (Stenting and Angioplasty with Protection in Patients and HighRisk for Endarterectomy) registry sponsored by Cordis Endovascular. both higher, but then we need to factor in the payments. The difference in Diagnosis-Related Group payment for uncomplicated cases is about $\\$ 4000$ higher for carotid stenting, ${ }^{2}$ so that is what the government's incremental cost would be for each Medicare patient converted to CAS. Because each hospital tends to lose $\\sim \\$ 1300$ on a CEA and $\\sim \\$ 3200$ on a stent, ${ }^{2}$ the average net increase in loss to the hospitals for each Medicare patient converted from CEA to CAS is $\\$ 1900$. We can thus conclude that if an additional 50,000 patients per year were to be switched from CEA to CAS so that the percentages of CEA and CAS became similar (ie, 50\\% for CAS and 50\\% for CEA), the hospitals would lose an additional $\\$ 95$ million each year, despite Medicare making an additional $\\$ 200$ million in payments to the hospitals. These facts further highlight the conclusion of Paraskevas et $\\mathrm{al}^{1}$ that diverting a large number of patients to stenting has a huge economic impact.

Many studies have shown that variations in gene expression among individuals, as well as among cell types, contribute to phenotype diversity and disease susceptibility. Recent genome-wide expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) association (GWEA) studies have provided information on genetic factors, especially SNPs, that are associated with gene expression variation. These expression-associated SNPs (exSNPs) have already been utilized to explain some results of GWAS for diseases, but interpretation of the data is handicapped by low reproducibility of the genotype-expression relationships. Methods To address this problem, we established several gold standard sets of high-reliability exSNPs based on multiple occurrences in different GWEA studies in various human populations and cell types. We then related these data to results from GWAS for diseases, to find a set of disease-associated loci that are likely to have an underlying expression mechanism. HapMap linkage disequilibrium data were utilized to allow the comparison of GWEA results from studies that employed different microarray SNP sets. Results We integrated the current gold standard data with SNPs in diseasecssociated loci from the Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium (WTCCC) GWAS of seven common human diseases. Approximately one-third of these disease-associated loci in the WTCCC GWAS were found to be consistent with an underlying expression change mechanism. Comparing separate gold standard sets for Caucasian (CEU), African (YRI) and Asian (ASNI) populations also allowed us to investigate which exSNPs contribute to population-specific eQTLs. Conclusions Use of the gold standard set of SNP-expression relationships has enabled us to more reliably determine the role of expression changes in common human diseases.

Thirty-four ribosomal proteins ( $r$-proteins) are universally conserved in the three domains of cellular life (Bacteria, Archaea and Eukarya), and 33 r-proteins are shared between Archaea and Eukarya to the exclusion of Bacteria; there are also 23 Bacteria-specific 1, Archaea-specific and 11 Eukarya-specific $r$-proteins [1]. Despite the high sequence conservation of $r$-proteins, the annotation of $r$-protein genes is often difficult because of their short lengths and biased sequence composition. Methods To perform a comprehensive survey of prokaryotic r-proteins, we developed an automated computational pipeline for the identification of $r$-protein genes and applied it to 995 completely sequenced bacterial genomes and 87 archaeal genomes available in the RefSeq database. The pipeline employs curated seed alignments of $r$-proteins to run position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM)-based BLAST searches against six-frame genome translations, thus overcoming possible gene annotation errors. Likely false positives are identified using comparisons against the original seed alignments. Results In the course of this analysis, we gained insight into the diversity of prokaryotic r-protein complements, such as missing and paralogous $r$-proteins and distributions of $r$-protein genes among chromosomal partitions. A phylogenetic tree was constructed from a concatenated alignment of 50 almost-ubiquitous bacterial r-proteins. The topology of the tree is generally compatible with the current high-level bacterial taxonomy, although we detected several inconsistencies, possibly indicating uncertain or erroneous classification of the respective bacteria. Similarly, a concatenated alignment of 57 ubiquitous archaeal proteins was used for an archaeal phylogenetic tree reconstruction. In both Bacteria and Archaea, the patterns of the presence/absence of non-ubiquitous r-proteins suggest several independent losses and/or gains of these proteins. According to parsimony reconstruction, three bacterial and five archaeal r-proteins do not appear to be ancestral. Remarkably, all five non-ancestral archaeal r-proteins are present in Eukarya. Conclusions Extended sets of prokaryotic r-proteins were created. Alignments of these sets may be used as new seed profiles for the identification of $r$-proteins in new genomes and for comparative genomics studies. Reference 1.

In a few notable cases, actionable information has been discovered from sequencing, and the number of such cases is likely to increase. At present, there are no widely accepted genomic standards or quantitative performance metrics. These are needed to achieve the confidence in measurement results that is expected for sound, reproducible research and regulated applications. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has been approached about considering development in this area by several commercial entities and regulatory agencies. There is great enthusiasm for translation of sequencing from the research community to clinical practice, and standards that can be used to inform confidence in measurement results (for instance, through validation studies, proficiency testing and routine quality assurance) may be an enabling factor in that goal. NIST is currently gathering input from the genomics community about which reference materials and data would be useful. For example, NIST and the Coriell Institute for Medical Research may develop genomic reference material from cell lines from families that have already been characterized by a variety of sequencing methods (for example, the cell line from which NA12878 DNA is derived). In addition, we may build synthetic DNA constructs to test specific questions about measuring different types of variants or combinations of variants in different genomic contexts. For example, we might create pairs of constructs with single nucleotide polymorphisms, indels and/or structural variants in GC- or AT-rich regions or repeat regions. To ensure the design of appropriate standards, we are interested in discussing the design and application of genomic reference materials with any interested parties.

The experimental methods for testing PPIs are time-consuming and are limited by analogs for many reactions. As a result, a computational model is necessary to predict PPIs and to explore the consequences of signal alterations in biological pathways. Reproductive control of the vector Anopheles gambiae using transgenic techniques poses a serious challenge. To meet this challenge, it would help to define the biological network involving the male accessory gland (MAG) proteins responsible for successful formation of the mating plug [1]. This plug forms in the male and is transferred to the female during mating, hence initiating the PPIs in both sexes. As is the case in Drosophila melanogaster, a close relative of $A$. gambiae, some MAG proteins responsible for the formation of the mating plug have been shown to alter the post-mating behavior of females. Methods and results The STRING database for known PPIs was used to identify orthologs of A. gambiae proteins in Drosophila (Table 1). Twentyseven proteins are known to form the mating plug in A. gambiae, and 16 others were obtained as strings in the STRING database. Chromosome synteny comparisons for proteins with more than $50 \\%$ identity between species were carried out using the Artemis Comparison Tool (ACT version 9.0), and this showed 24.39\\% matches (M). 12.20\\% mismatches (MM) and $63.41 \\%$ unmatched (NM). The network built in Cytoscape (version 2.8.0) with the UniProt IDs for these Drosophila orthologs showed 14 complexes, with 4 of them being for Drosophila. The network showed 555 nodes and 2,344 edges. The top 50 identified hubs in the network showed a range of 3 to 30 interactions. The expression values for these proteins in FlyAtlas showed that"

Far down in Alabama where the \"Black Belt\" is broad and the Negroes outnumber the whites, I touched upon something that class-rooms and concert-halls rarely hold,-nothing less than the primitive essence of untaught and unteachable creative art. It was at the Calhoun Industrial School (whose existence was inspired by the example of Hampton Institute) that a great meeting of colored people was held one year to listen to discussions by Northern white scholars concerning the advancement of their race. Over tawny roads that stretched beneath tall pine trees came the people of the \"Black Belt\" in wagons and astride of plodding mules; brown mules, black mules, lemon-colored mules -they came with their dusky riders from all directions in an endless stream, and I particularly remember the flash of a red petticoat across a white mule glinting through the green. Such shining good-natured faces,-pure Negroes these with little admixture of white blood, representing different types of the many tribes brought from all parts of Africa by the slave-trade, through which captives from the far interior and from the opposite coasts of the Dark Continent were finally landed in America. Some of the men were tall, and their aquiline noses and pointed beards told of the strain of Arab and other Semitic blood that runs through many a native of Africa's East Coast; others were swart and thickset, with flat noses and heavy lips. Many were so ebony black that the shadows in their smooth skins seemed a soft gray-purple, like deep ripe grapes. No European peasantry could have offered to the painter more striking material than these dark-skinned sinewy people in their blue jeans and bright calicoes amid the deep tones of the pines.

In this model, as in other models of portal hypertension, the arterial vascular reactivity to endogenous vasoconstrictors is lluunted [3-6]. One mechanism proposed to account for these findings is the effect of $c$ ne or more endogenous humoral vasodilators which, while rapidly metabolized by the normal liver, are present at increased levels in portal hypertension accompanied by functional and/or anatomical partial blood shunting. Bile acid:s may be one of these vasodilators in that they have known vasoactive effects $[7-8]$, are rapidly cleared by the normal liver [9] and are present at increased levels in liver disease $[9,10]$. The contrising features of these two experimental models, the increase in serum bile acids after $\\bar{\\tau}^{\\prime} \\mathrm{V}$ [11] and the fact that development of portal hypertension in experimental animals and in patients with arterial hypertension frequently results in the amelioration of arterial hypertension [12-15]. promoted us to investigate the systemic hemodynamic effects of PVL in SHR and their relationship to serum bile acid levels. This study demonstrates that the normalization of arterial pressure in SHR with prehepatic portal hypertension is due to a decrease in total peripheral resistance. In addition, while bile acids may represent a prototype of substances increased by functional or anatomical portal-systemic shunting they have, at most, a minor direct role in this observed arterial hypotensive effect. Methods Male SHR and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) controls (Charles River Laboratories, Cambridge, MA) 11-13 weeks old were used. SHR were studied 2 and 15 weeks after induction of portal hypertension by partial portal vein ligation (SHR-PVL) or a sham operation (SHR-SH) as previously described [2]. Two weeks after PVL portal hypertension and the systemic and splanchnic circulatory abnormalities observed in this model are fully developed [16]. The SHR-SH group served as arterial hypertensive controls. The normotensive controls (WKY) remained free of manipulation prior to sidly. Animals were studied 15 weeks after PVL or SH to assess the duration of the hemodynamic changes. Animals were housed in plexiglass cages and allowed free access to rat chow (Ralston Purina, SL Louis, MO) and water until the time of study. Hemodynamic studies Hemodynamic studies were performed after 2 weeks in ten SHR-PVL, nine SHR-SH and eight WKY controls and after 15 weeks in five SHR-PVL and eight SHR-SH. Blood flow determinations at 2 weeks in three SHR-PVL, one SHR-SH and one WKY and at 15 weeks in use SHR-PVL and one SHR-SH, were excluded due to asymmetry in the distribution of microspheres to the kidneys and/or testes. Sequential systolic arterial pressure measurements using : doppler tail cuff technique were performed at $1,2,4,5.5,6.5,12$ and 14 weeks in the 15 week groups. The techniques used for the hemodynamic measurements in the portal hypertensive and control animals have been detailed in previous communications from this laboratory $[2,16]$. Briefly, the animals were anesthetized with ketamine $\\mathrm{HCl}(100 \\mathrm{mg} / \\mathrm{kg}$ body weight i.m.). The left femoral and right carotid arteries were exposed and cannulated with $\\mathrm{PC}-50$ catheters. Each catheter was connected to a Statham P-23Db strain gauge transducer and permanent recordings of arterial pressure and portal pressure were made on a Grass Model 7D inscription recorder. The right carotid catheter was advanced into the left ventricle during continuous pressure monitoring. Intra. splenic pressure, an indirect measurement of portal pressure, was measured as previously described [2]. The body temperature was maintained at $37 \\pm 0.5^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C}$ (rectal). An intraventricular injection of radiolabeled microspheres was performed for blood flow measurements using a reference sample method previously used in our laboratory $[2,16]$. Portal-systemic shunting along the splenoportal axis was measured by intrasplenic injection of a second different radioactive microsphere, a technique previously described in our laboratory [17].

                "value": " CLINICAL PRESENTATION Table 1 lists the aminoacidopathies which are responsible for serious disease in the newborn period (defined as the first month of life). This rapidly growing list of conditions involves several classes of amino acids or their organic acid derivatives (branched-chain, urea cycle, sulphur-containing, glycine, aromatic, $\\beta$-amino acompounds and dipeptides). No fewer than eight different enzymatic defects of branched chain amino acids or their catabolites cause neonatal signs and symptoms; and five disorders of urea cycle enzymes do likewise. Despite this impressive biochemical heterogeneity, the clinical findings are surprisingly similar, most of these disorders presenting with failure to feed, vomiting, lethargy, coma or seizures, usually after the initiation of protein feeds. This clinical similarity is mirrored by a less constant group of routine laboratory abnormalities including a low serum bicarbonate concentration, hypoglycaemia, ketonaemia, ketonuria and hyperammonaemia. Since many of these clinical or laboratory findings are seen in far more common disorders of the neonate such as sepsis, transient hypoglycaemia or hypocalcaemic tetany, it is not surprising that the aminoacidopathies in question have regularly been undiagnosed or detected only several days after the onset of clinical feedings. One or more of the following findings may serve as valuable diagnostic clues to the presence of these aminoacidopathies: (1) a family history of a previous sibling with similar or identical neonatal findings; (2) an unusual odour to the infant's body or urine such as the odour of maple syrup in branched-chain ketoaciduria or of'sweaty feet' in isovalericacidaemia; (3) the temporal onset of neurological dysfunction after initiating protein feeding, rather than during the first twelve hours of life; (4) the blood $\\mathrm{pH}$ which will often reveal metabolic acidosis in several of the disorders of branched-chain amino acid metabolism, and respiratory alkalosis in defects of the urea cycle; (5) the blood ammonia which will often be distinctly elevated in disorders of the urea cycle and branched-chain amino acids, but not in infants with sepsis, tetany or hypoglycaemia. Of greater value than any of these clues, however, is a high order of suspicion, based on the recognition that such inherited disorders of amino acid metabolism exist and produce symptoms in the neonatal period. SPECIFIC DIAGNOSTIC TESTS The specific diagnostic tests for the disorders being considered vary greatly in methodology, complexity, and availability. A simple, one-dimension paper chromatogram of blood or urine is very valuable in the diagnosis of those conditions in which ninhydrin-positive amino acids accumulate (branchedchain ketoaciduria, valinaemia, isovalericacidaemia, citrullinaemia, argininosuccinicaciduria, argininaemia, hyperglycinaemia, tyrosinaemia, $\\beta$-alaninaemia, and carnosinaemia) but will not detect those conditions in which organic acid derivatives or ammonia accumulate, e.g. isovaleric acidaemia, propionicacidaemia, methylmalonicaciduria, or deficiency of sulphite oxidase, carbamyl phosphate synthetase I, and ornithine transcarbamylase."

                "value": " BER performance for small $S I R$ values i.e. when the interference signal is strong as compared to the OFDM signal. At high SIR values, the proposed cancellation algorithm has worse performance than the case of no NBI cancellation. This is explained as at high $S I R$, the NBI signal is very small as compared to the OFDM signal, and therefore, the NBI is very difficult to extract from the received signal. Further, at high $S I R$ the presence of the estimator will cause a noise enhancement to the OFDM system with variance equal to $\\left(\\sigma_{s}^{2}+\\sigma_{n}^{2}\\right) /(2 K+1)$ per real dimension (see (12)). However, at high $S I R$, the effect of the NBI on the OFDM system (without cancellation) becomes negligible and the BER reaches an asymptote. This asymptote depends on the $S N R$, as AWGN is the dominating disturbance on the OFDM system. Note however that the difference between in BER no cancellation for the proposed algorithm becomes small when the gap $M$ increases. Therefore, we can conclude that the proposed algorithm works well when $M$ is chosen sufficiently large. Fig 7 shows the total variance $\\sigma_{I}^{2}$ of the estimator as function of the number $N_{I}$ of NBI signals in two cases. In case 'A', we consider that the $S I R$ is fixed per interferer, so the total $S I R$ decreases inversely proportional to $N_{I}$. In case 'B', we consider a fixed total $S I R$, i.e. $S I R$ per interferer decreases linearly as $N_{I}$ increases. As can be observed, the variance of the estimator increases with $N_{I}$. This is because the noise caused by other NBI signal increases with $N_{I}$. The corresponding BER performance of the MC system is shown in Fig. 8. We note that the BER is essentially independent of $N_{I}$ at $M=16$ : the spectrum leakage from the NBI signals on the MC signal becomes very small when $M$ increases. 5. Conclusions In this paper, a new NBI cancellation scheme for MC systems has been proposed. The estimator is based on averaging the received baseband samples over a sliding window. It can be used to suppress the spectral leakage that occurs when many digitally modulated NBI signals reside in the same frequency band of the MC signal. Further, we have derived the mean squared error (MSE) of the estimator in an analytical way. Simulation results show that the theoretical expressions for the MSE agree well with the simulation. Moreover, bit error rate performance shows that the proposed estimator performs well especially if the MC system avoids the use of a number of subcarriers around the NBI frequencies."

                "value": " DISCUSSION If fish spawn once a year, a feature of fish production is seasonal fluctuation of the commercial-size fish supply. One of the measures used to increase production capacity is to carry out reproduction year round which entails the necessity to conduct out-of-season reproduction. It is then necessary to perform hormonal stimulation in order to obtain high quality gametes $[10,20,31]$. In percids, hCG stimulation is applied successfully and induces ovulation after a single injection [15]. In the present study, hCG administration caused synchronous ovulation in $75 \\%$ of females during the out-of-season spawning. It is noteworthy that the variable quality of oocytes (expressed as embryo survival at the pigmented-eyed stage) is typical for off-season reproduction in percids [10, 25, 31]. Therefore, the results of out-of-season reproduction obtained in the study should be regarded as satisfactory. The observed variability in embryo survival could also result from variable effectiveness of spontaneous reproduction and other potentially stress-inducing manipulations applied (e.g. catheterization). Such variable results were obtained by Ronyai and Lengyel [29] during the reproductive season when spontaneous reproduction was examined. Thus, the FOM observed in the present study proceeded typically for the species. Moreover, none of the changes observed in hCG-treated fish were observed in control females examined at the end of the experiment. The lack of progression in maturation of females which were not hormonally stimulated confirms the necessity of hormonal stimulation in out-of-season reproduction in Eurasian perch [23, 31]. The proposed classification of oocyte maturity stages covers the entire FOM including stage I in which, in addition to the GV in the central position, yolk granularities at the oocyte edge were also visible $[24,30]$. It is noteworthy that no oil droplets were visible at this stage (fig. 2a). Only the application of the out-of-season reproduction allowed oocytes to be observed at the beginning of FOM and simultaneous progression in maturation in all hCG-treated females. The germinal vesicle position in non-ovulated perch oocytes was difficult to determine when the previous (developed for cyprinids) classification was used. The precise localization of the GV requires tilting or rolling individual oocyte for it be viewed from several angles. Variability in the intensity of cytoplasm clarification with the use of Serra's solution might also have a negative effect on maturation"

(Received 9 jure 1978)  (Accepted 6 June 1978)  SUMMARY A highly specific pancreatitis primarily affecting the intralobular and intrasinsular ductules has been demonstrated in Syrian golden hamsters bearing homologous, non-syngeneic, transplantable pancreatic adenocarcinoma induced by $N$-nitrosobis(2-oxopropyl)amine (BOP). The ductulitis provides further evidence that induced pancreatic neoplasms originate from ductules. INTRODUCTION The induction of pancreatic neoplasms in Syrian golden hamsters by specific nitrosamines [3-5] provides a tool for investigating various aspects of pancreatic carcinogenesis. The significant advantage of this modei is the close resemblance of the induced tumors, morphologically and biologically, to tumors occurring in man [3]. Studies of this histogenesis of pancreatic neoplasms in this model indicate that the ductules, especially those of intrasinsular origin, are the primary target cells of the relatively specific pancreatic carcinogen BOP $[6,9]$. The present report on pancreatic alterations in recipients of homologous, non-syngeneic, transplantable, BOP-induced, pancreatic ad inocarcinomas supports the theory of a ductular origin of the induced neoplasms. MATERIALS AND METHODS Initially, 5 male, 8-week-old random-bred Syrian hamster: from the Eppley Colony were inoculated subcutaneously in the interscapular area with minced tissue from a single BOP-induced pancreatic adenocarcinoma [5].

As a result of its long history of oppression, the University of Barcelona is mandated by the Parliament of Catalonia to foster and maintain Catalan by using it as a LoLT alongside Spanish. In this case, as in the case of Helsinki and Ottawa, financial support is provided by the regional authorities so that universities can carry out these mandates. The histories of South African universities that are currently using explicitly bilingual models of education are obviously closely linked to the recent history of apartheid and the suppression of local people and their languages - a position from which Afrikaans benefited. The historical borders were (and still are) racial ones. Historically Afrikaans universities (the HAUs) were founded in areas where Afrikaans speakers were concentrated and where well-resourced schools produced the students for these institutions. The HAUs use English increasingly as a LoLT but there are also attempts to maintain Afrikaans and to develop indigenous languages as academic languages. Although one can argue for the maintenance of Afrikaans in the light of the national language policy for higher education, it must always be seen in the perspective of its racist legacy. At some South African institutions, bilingual education practices are being developed in the form of study materials in African languages and African language requirements for staff. These are, however, recent developments that have yet to be woven into the fabric that constitutes an institutional 'history'. The social and historical contexts within which these universities operate are multilingual but home language speakers of English are generally a minority. The situation is similar to that in European universities where English is used increasingly as part of an internationalisation strategy: the majority of students and staff use English as an additional language and it is not spoken much outside the university gates. As such, the HAUs offer interesting insights into bilingual teaching and learning. Socio-structural factors Social structures in this case refer to the relative status of languages in bi/ multilingual communities, where high status is a reflection of the degree to which one language is seen to give access to power. When one studies the context within which bilingual universities function, one has to take socio-structural factors into account because the students carry the values and prestige that communities attach to languages into the classrooms. In bilingual institutions, it is seldom the case that both languages have equal status. When English is one of the LoLTs, it is usually valued very highly and people generally fear that its high status may eventually push out the lower status language. At the University of Ottawa, the status of English and the fact that the majority of students are English-speaking have led to entrance tests for French and English being abandoned, since very few English-speaking students are fluent enough in French to be able to study through it. At the HAUs in South Africa, Afrikaans is generally valued quite highly by its speakers but it is also stigmatised as a barrier to access. In contrast, the status of English and the lure of jobs overseas mean that many Afrikaans students themselves clamour for English instruction. If bilingual teaching can be seen as a socio-structural balancing of the status of two languages, the high status 'weight' of English as a world language can be"

Carethers, MD  Colorectal cancer develops through a sequence of events that leaves a trail of pathologic lesions to study. Over the past decade, the adenomatous polyp has been the subject of intense scrutiny, and the results of this investigation have been astounding, opening a new paradigm for tumorigenesis that has stimulated study in a wide variety of neoplasms. With the realization that certain genetic events may be accountable for colorectal tumorigenesis, several laboratories have identified many of the genes thought responsible for the progression from normal colonic mucosa to carcinoma, through the so-called adenoma-to-carcinoma sequence. Colorectal tumorigenesis is most certainly a disease of the genes, with accumulations of genetic alterations and progressive waves of clonal expansion of cells that have a growth advantage over their progenitors. These alterations include mutations in the K-ras oncogene and a new model consisting of a concomitant mutation in one allele together with loss of the other allele in tumor suppressor genes such as $A P C$, $P 53$, and DCC. Sequential mutation or loss of these genes occurs during the progression of colonic neoplasia from benign to malignant stages. In addition, at least two of these genetic changes, those found with $A P C$ and $P 53$, correlate with major histologic transitions into, and out of, the adenomatous polyp.

For three million peasant workers gaining urban registration, the total cost for these two benefits alone would amount to about 5-6 billion yuan a year. ${ }^{16}$ In addition, there would be indirect costs for the provisions of public rental housing, education, public health, and so on, another 2 billion a year in Huang's estimate ${ }^{17}$ (Huang Qifan, 2010f). How would the expenses of some 8 billion yuan a year be funded? As Huang puts it, enterprises will be expected to bear the lion's share, but the Chongqing government will bear several billion of the 8 billion. As can readily be seen, the cost, while high, is not unaffordable to a government that in 2009 was spending nearly 90 billion a year for \"people's livelihood,\" with the money coming, we have seen, in large measure from land and the third finance. According to Huang, Chongqing's income from assigning land to private developers alone amounted to 98 billion yuan in 2010, as compared with just 0.2 billion yuan in 2001, before the Chongqing government undertook the systematic \"storing up\" of land for development purposes (Huang Qifan, 2011b). The Chongqing government, in fact, has made social equity its primary goal. In Bo Xilai's words, it has set itself the target to reduce by 2015 the current urban-rural income gap from 3.4:1 down to 2.5:1 and to reduce the municipality's Gini coefficient (for measuring inequality, with 0 being completely equal and 1 being maximally unequal) from 0.42 down to 0.35 (those being the quantitative measurements used by the World Bank) (Bo Xilai, 2011a). At a Gini coefficient of 0.35, China would return nearly to the 0.33 figure that had been the legacy of the Maoist period at the start of the reform era. ${ }^{18}$ Considering the special circumstances of this municipality (with 20 poor counties and districts and a peasant majority), this would be a big and impressive step forward in social equity. Economically Sustainable? Just how economically sustainable, we must ask, can such an order of government expenditures for social equity be? Will it not, in time, cave under the weight of social welfare spending as \"land financing\" runs out, development slows down, and expenses go up? Or, will it, as in Huang Qifan's and Bo Xilai's conception, become a critical dynamic for sustained overall development in Chongqing? Huang's conception includes a number of dimensions, all interconnected. First among them is that such programs of social equity will help enlarge China's domestic demand 内需 and market.

As many as $80 \\%$ of familial cases of phosphate wasting have XLH with documented PHEX mutations; however, PHEX mutations are found in less than $50 \\%$ of patients with sporadic forms of phosphate wasting. ${ }^{28}$ Some sporadic cases thought to have XLH may prove to have ADHR instead. It is important to determine which disease a family has because erroneous assumptions about inheritance may lead to incorrect genetic counseling or questioning of paternity if a male patient with ADHR who is told his family has XLH, has an unaffected daughter. Because the primary defect in ADHR results in isolated phosphate wasting, it is likely that the gene for ADHR has a role in phosphate homeostasis. Current models of phosphate homeostasis indicate that renal phosphate wasting could result from mutations in genes that serve one or more of the following roles: - The gene product senses extracellular phosphate concentrations. - The gene encodes a renal phosphate-wasting hormone (phosphatonin) or activates a renal phosphate-wasting hormone receptor (including associated $G$ proteins or other effector molecules). - The gene encodes a phosphate-conserving hormone or its receptor. - The gene is a repressor or inducer for the previously mentioned hormones. - The gene product activates or degrades these hormones (as is likely with PHEX). - The gene encodes a sodium-dependent phosphate cotransporter. Isolation of the ADHR gene may result in the identification of one of the genes proposed in these models. If the ADHR gene encodes a protein that has none of these functions, its isolation would likely change the current model and provide a better understanding of ADHR pathogenesis. Hypophosphatemic Bone Disease In 1977 Scriver and co-workers ${ }^{72}$ described five small families with a disorder they named hypophosphatemic bone disease. In one family, there was evidence of father-to-son disease transmission, indicating an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. Individuals with hypophosphatemic bone disease demonstrated renal phosphate wasting, short stature, and lower-extremity deformities. Affected children in these kindreds did not demonstrate radiographic rickets. In other respects, patients with hypophosphatemic bone disease seemed to be similar to patients with other forms of inherited phosphate wasting. Because radiographic rickets is not universal in children with $\\mathrm{XLH},{ }^{22}$ it is possible that rickets is not invariant in ADHR; therefore, hypophosphatemic bone disease may not be distinct from ADHR. Definitive evidence awaits identification of the hypophosphatemic bone disease and ADHR gene defects."

SP-C gene targeted mice (Stfpc -/-) lack SP-C, develop an ILD-like disease and are susceptible to infection with RSV. Methods: In order to determine requirements for correction of RSV induced injury we have generated compound transgenic mice where SP-C expression can be induced on the Stfpc -/- background (SP-C/Stfpc -/-) by the administration of doxycycline (dox). The pattern of induced SP-C expression was determined by immunohistochemistry and processing by Western blot analysis. Tissue and cellular inflammation was measured following RSV infection and the RSV-induced cytokine response of isolated Stfpc +/+ and -/- type II cells determined. Results: After 5 days of dox administration transgene SP-C mRNA expression was detected by RT-PCR in the lungs of two independent lines of bitransgenic SP-C/Stfpc -/- mice (lines 55.3 and 54.2). ProSP-C was expressed in the lung, and mature SP-C was detected by Western blot analysis of the lavage fluid from both lines of SP-C/Stfpc -/mice. Induced SP-C expression was localized to alveolar type II cells by immunostaining with an antibody to proSPC. Line 55.3 SP-C/Stfpc -/- mice were maintained on or off dox for 7 days and infected with $2.6 \\times 10^{7}$ RSV pfu. On day 3 post RSV infection total inflammatory cell counts were reduced in the lavage of dox treated 55.3 SP-C/Stfpc -/mice $(p=0.004)$. The percentage of neutrophils was reduced $(p=0.05)$. The viral titers of lung homogenates from dox treated 55.3 SP-C/Stfpc -/- mice were decreased relative to 55.3 SP-C/Stfpc -/- mice without dox $(p=0.01)$. The cytokine response of Stfpc -/- type II cells to RSV was increased over that of Stfpc +/+ cells. Conclusions: Transgenic restoration of SP-C reduced inflammation and improved viral clearance in the lungs of SP$C$ deficient mice. The loss of SP-C in alveolar type II cells compromises their response to infection. These findings show that the restoration of SP-C in Stfpc -/- mice in response to RSV infection is a useful model to determine parameters for therapeutic intervention.

The unit is widely dominated by the endemic tree Myrceugenia schulzei, joined by Coprosma pyrifolia, Rhaphithamnus venustus, and Fagara externa. Endemic herbaceous species are Peperomia skottsbergii and Haloragis masafuerana. It seems to be one of the least degraded units of the island due to difficult access, but the overall level of endemism is relative low as it covers only limited area. It is also possible that the richness of this unit actually is higher but it has been rarely surveyed due to the aforementioned difficulties. In spite of the fact that Santalum fernandezianum is considered to have gone extinct long ago, there is a small possibility that a living exemplar of this species might be found in this unit. Degraded myrtisylva seem to be the degraded version of the former one, situated mainly between 100 and $650 \\mathrm{~m}$, in the more accessible valleys of the eastern part of the island. The level of anthropogenic impacts is high, related to overgrazing and fires, to the point that physiognomically it resembles an open forest rather than a myrtisylva. Nevertheless, some very rare endemic species such as Ranunculus caprarum have been reported here, only with few individuals. Cliff vegetation is situated mainly on the western side of the island, between 400 and 1,000 m. It shows a high number of endemic species (23 taxa). Characteristic endemic species are Coprosma pyrifolia, Rhaphithamnus venustus, Acaena masafuerana and Galium masafueranum, together with Uncinia costata and Erigeron turricola. From the endemic Asteraceae, Dendroseris macrophylla and D. regia are to be found at very few sites. It is possible that Dendroseris gigantea, and the putatively extinct Chenopodium nesodendron could have been common in this unit once. Coastal vegetation occupies a thin band in contact with the sea, along the coast surrounding most of the island, characterized by a scanty herbaceous vegetation of Nassella laevissima, Brassica oleracea, Juncus procerus, together with the fern Asplenium obtusatum. Herbaceous endemic species typical of the unit are Erigeron rupicola, Nicotiana cordifolia, Spergularia masafuerana and Spergularia confertiflora. Rocks and eroded areas occupy highly degraded sites above the coastal vegetation with introduced and native grasses. In spite of this, several endemic herbaceous species can be found here, such as Haloragis masafuerana or Wahlenbergia masafuerae. Creek bottom vegetation, occurring in the deepest part of the quebradas of the eastern side, is adapted to extreme shady conditions. It is composed by many different ferns, such as Blechnum longicauda, and several Peperomia species, together with Gunnera masafuerae, Urtica glumeruliflora, Erigeron fernandezianus, E. stuessyi, Wahlenbergia tuberosa and scanty exemplars of Sophora masafuerana.

It seems probable that they are merely driven to the spleen and bone marrow. In any event quinin produces no changes whatever in morphology of the fully developed gametes. Koch showed in 1908 that in Babesia (Piroplasma) bigemina one stage occurs in the eggs of the tick and is transmitted thereby to the second generation of ticks. Carter found that Spirochaete Duttoni multiplied in the ova of ticks and thus infected the second generation. In flies this may be the usual or the only method of transmission from one generation of the host to the next. Extensive experimental researches on the drug treatment of Piroplasma have come from Nuttall's laboratory at Cambridge, England. Other contributions from the same source deal with the development of Piroplasma canis, $P$. bovis, and other species, and with Theileria parva. Hepatosoon perniciosum (n. g., n. sp.) a hemogregamine pathogenic for white rats has been studied by Miller (1908) who finds the sexual cycle in a mite (Lelaps echidininus). The great variety of records concerning the occurrence of Sarcosporidia in man of which only two or three cases are positively known, lends special interest to the report of Darling (1909b) concerning a new case. The author regards it as a chance infection of a species different from those hitherto reported from man, but not definitely determined. The sporozoa disappeared from the muscle fibers of the subject and this probably took place on a date when the sporozoites were observed escaping from their capsule. He concludes that such infection gives rise to little or no discomfort. The case was complicated by intercurrent typhoid fever. Renewed investigations by Bensen (1909) demonstrate the specific distinctness of Trichomonas intestinalis and Tr. vaginalis. A study of the life history shows that Trichomonas intestinalis throws off its flagella and becomes amoeboid. After encystment a new generation is formed. Tr. vaginalis encysts in the flagellate stage and after that becomes amoeboid. The same author (1908) has monographed the genus Lamblia."

                "value": " ley et al., 1985) shows a typical cross-reaction on the schizont extract. Several families of cross-reacting antigens possess members present in quite different concentrations, with some of them being released into the culture supernatant at the time of schizont rupture, while others remain attached to the merozoite. Binding of antibodies to antigens released in the culture supernatant may contribute to the protection of the merozoite. The paradox of $96 \\mathrm{tR}$ is that it is poorly immunogenic under natural conditions, but nevertheless binds antibodies induced by several antigens. In humans, the kinetics of production of antibodies to $96 \\mathrm{t} R$ parallels the acquisition of immune protection. Furthermore, antibodies to $96 \\mathrm{t} R$ are rapidly lost in the absence of boosting (Dubois et al., 1987; Jouin et al., 1987). The decline in antibodies roughly coincides with the loss of immunity. Whatever the role of $96 \\mathrm{tR}$ in protection, these observations led us to consider the paradoxical hypothesis that the target antigens may not be immunogenic, but the immune response to them is indeed induced by cross-reacting antigens sharing related sequences. If this is true, a large number of infections may be necessary to achieve correct maturation of the immune response. Concluding remarks There are many ways of getting rid of malaria parasites: blocking of invasion (sporozoites and merozoites), killing of the extracellular parasites by phagocytosis, cytoxicity to the infected cell (antibody or cell-mediated), blocking of sexual reproduction through antibodies ingested in the blood meal (Miller et al., 1986) (see list, table I). At each of these immune mechanisms, several parasite antigens can be recognized and thus may be the target of a protective response. Many of the antigens identified so far are polymorphic, while others are poorly immunogenic. It is conceivable that no individual will use the entire panel of possible effector mechanisms. This is either because the parasite presents a previously unencountered serotype or because of intrinsic difficulties in responding to a given antigen in a protective manner. Antigenic polymorphism may also have as a consequence the fact that some individuals may be able to respond to some of the allelic forms and not to others, and thus will not use the same immune mechanisms against all strains. The combination of these factors complicates the study of natural immunity. Is natural polymorphism correctly appreciated? Serotypes observed in 1989-1990 are closely related to those found in laboratory strains, most of which were collected long ago. This does not mean that they are represented in the field in the same proportion. We feel that definitive conclusions on the prevalence of alleles should not be drawn from laboratory strains. Many laboratory strains resemble FCR3 in several markers and may indeed derive from it. This is most likely in the case of the in vitro-derived Palo Alto parasites (Fandeur et al., 1991). The limited data available from field isolates do not point to a major tendency toward rapid genetic drift. But this precise point must be specifically explored. It is not an easy task to look for new specificities at a population scale. PCR allows access to genes from a large number of strains. Analysis of the amplified products is rapid if one looks for the presence of known allelic forms, but much more laborious if new alleles are to be investigated. To our know i.e.g., except for the CS protein (de la Cruz et al., 1989), the immune response of several individuals to the various allelic forms of a given antigen has still not been assayed. As far as P190 is concerned, many individuals have antibodies to this antigen whatever the strain used to test them. Does this mean that there may be antibodies reacting with allele-specific determinants as well as antibodies reacting with common epitopes? Sites relevant for protective immunity on many of the molecules remain to be identified, and consequently the response to them needs to be assayed in successive infections. In the absence of reinfection, immune pressure finally leads to the elimination of low grade parasitaemia. This shows that, despite its slow acquisition, immunity finally takes over. Interestingly, in the monkey infections where antigenic variation has been observed, the first peak of parasitaemia is substantially higher than the subsequent ones (Hommel $e t$ al., 1983; Handunetti et al., 1987). This might indicate that an immune response to a conserved epitope or antigen is being slowly mounted, resulting in an increasingly efficient immunity. Furthermore, protection experiments using merozoite antigens from one allelic type as immunogen followed by a challenge using parasites of another allelic type indicated that protection may transcend strain-specific determinants (Perrin et al., 1984b; Pattaroyo et al., $1987,1988)$. The complexity of the possible combinations of allele-specific responses and immune evasion mechanisms is such that it is likely that immunity exerts its pressure at several!-svels. Whereas protective immunity probably has a strain-specific component, there is also a strong possibility that immunity transcends strain specificity and that common, but less immunogenic determinants also come into play.

The present report has to do with the development of manufacturing methods. The bacteriological aspects of this study will be reported in a later publication. METHOD OF STUDY The batches of sweetened condensed milk were prepared in a commercial sized (36-inch) vacuum pan. The substitution of the sucrose for the high conversion corn sirup was on a dry matter basis. Pasteurized milk was preheated in an open type hot well with live steam. The sugar was added in the first series in the hot well before preheating, but in the last two series the milk and sugar solutions were preheated separately. The condensing process was continued until the finished product contained approximately 28 per cent milk solids, 42 per cent sugar and 70 per cent total solids in the case of the sweetened skim milk. The sweetened condensed whole milk was standardized to contain 8 per cent fat, 20 per cent serum solids, and 42 per cent sugar solids. The important variables that were introduced were 1) preheating temperature; 2) method of adding the sugar, 3) amounts and kinds of sugar added; and 4) the temperature and time of storage. These variables were used as shown in table 1. In order to study the effect of time and temperature during storage, a number of one-half pint glass milk bottles were filled from the batches of sweetened condensed skim milk designated in the table. The bottles were disc capped, sealed with hood caps, and divided into three groups. The first group was stored at $90^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$.; the second group was stored at $66^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$.; and the third group was stored at $40^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$. Samples stored thus were removed at definite intervals of time and examined for color, body (viscosity), flavor and acidity, and $\\mathrm{pH}$. Color determinations were first made with a $\\mathrm{K} \\& \\mathrm{E}$ color analyzer manufactured by the Keuffel \\& Esser Company of Hoboken, New Jersey. Due to physical changes in the condensed milk during storage at the high temperature, this method showed some inconsistency in results. Therefore, it was discontinued after four weeks. Thereafter the samples were grouped according to their color as determined visually by the judges. The viscosity or body was determined by two methods. One method was to use a pipette with the small end removed and calibrated to deliver $10 \\mathrm{ml}$. Two marks were placed on the pipette with a capacity of $5 \\mathrm{ml}$. between the two marks. By the use of a stopwatch the rate of flow from one mark to the other was determined, the temperature being constant at $100^{\\circ} \\mathrm{F}$. Here again difficulty was encountered because of the high viscosity that some of"

Poster 218  RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TARDIVE  DYSKINESIA, INTELLECTUAL  IMPAIRMENT AND BRADYPHRENIA IN A  CHRONIC SCHIZOPHRENIC INPATIENT  POPULATION  T.R.E. Barnes, C. Pantelis, S. Collinson, H.E. Nelson, K. Carruthers, S.M. Halstead Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School, St Dunstan's Rd., London W6 8RP, UK The relationship between cognitive impairment and tardive dyskinesia was investigated in 63 schizophrenic long-stay inpatients. Current intellectual functioning was measured using the WAIS-R. The NART and the Schonell Graded Word Reading Test assessed premorbid intellectual functioning and the Information Processing B test from the AMIPB assessed both motor and cognitive speed. Controlling for age and bradykinesia, current IQ levels were significantly lower in those patients with tardive dyskinesia compared with their nondyskinetic fellows, but there was no significant association between tardive dyskinesia and either estimated premorbid IQ or the estimated decline in IQ. This suggests that IQ may fall with the development of tardive dyskinesia. There was no significant difference between those patients with and without orofacial dyskinesia on the tests of motor speed, but the tests of cognitive speed showed those patients with orofacial dyskinesia to be significantly slower. Thus, in patients with schizophrenia the emergence of tardive dyskinesia may be associated with intellectual decline, particularly slowing of cognitive speed (bradyphrenia). The motor disorder and bradyphrenia may both be manifestations of a frontal-subcortical dementia. XII.A. Poster 219 TARDIVE DYSKINESIA INCIDENCE AND OUTCOME  J. Kane, M. Woerner, M. Borenstein  Hillside Hospital, 75-59 263rd Street, Glen Oaks, NY 11004, USA We have assessed the outcome of tardive dyskinesia developing among patients participating in a long-term prospective study. Over 850 patients have been followed for up to 12 years to determine the incidence of TD. Cumulative incidence is approximately $5 \\%$ per year of neuroleptic exposure. This report focuses on the outcome of TD among these prospectively developing cases. One hundred forty four cases of tardive dyskinesia were followed for a mean of 4.3 years after the emergence of their abnormal involuntary movements. The average age of this cohort was 29. Approximately $60 \\%$ showed remission of TD. Age, gender, diagnosis and length of neuroleptic treatment prior to the diagnosis of TD bore no relationship to the outcome. On the other hand, proportion of time on medication following the development of TD and the modal dose of neuroleptic (following diagnosis) did appear to be associated with outcome. XII.A. Poster 220 CIGARETTE SMOKING IS AN  INDEPENDENT RISK FACTOR OF  ABNORMAL INVOLUNTARY  MOVEMENTS - A STUDY OF MEN BORN IN 1933 A. Nilsson*, L. Waller, A. Rosengren, A. Adlerberth, L. Wilhelmsen *The Department of Forensic Psychiatry, Box 4042, 42204 Hisings Backa, and Department of Medicine, Östra Hospital, University of Göteborg, Sweden Aim: To estimate frequency, severity, and clinical risk factors of abnormal involuntary movements (tardive and spontaneous dyskinesia) in the general male population. Study population: A random sample of all men in Göteborg, Sweden, born in $1933(n=1016)$ and first investigated at age 50, whereby physical, laboratory, and psychosocial data were collected in $76 \\%(n=776)$. A follow-up investigation at age 59 included video-taped assessments of abnormal involuntary movements (AIMS) and EPS (Simpson \\& Angus scale) in 559 men. Results: $8.2 \\%(n=46)$ fulfilled the Schooler and Kane criteria for tardive dyskinesia (with the exception that all had not been exposed to neuroleptics). Their mean AIMS score, $5.0 \\pm 1.8$, indicated mild symptoms, most often involving the jaw. Dyskinetic men had higher frequencies of psychiatric morbidity, alcohol dependence, and exposure to neuroleptics as well as higher Simpson \\& Angus scores and cigarette consumption than non-dyskinetic men. Diabetes mellitus was not associated with dyskinesia. In a logistic regression model, exposure to neuroleptics and high consumption of cigarettes were identified as independent risk factors of abnormal involuntary movements. Smoking more than a pack a day carried a risk of abnormal involuntary movements almost equal to that of neuroleptic exposure alone."

We note that, for coarse crystallites, the Schmidt factor histogram for the $\\{101\\}\\langle 111\\rangle$ deformation system has two maxima, which is indicative of the nonuniformity of the elastic characteristics, including the acoustic characteristics. Thus, it is found that the attenuation of ultrasonic waves during inspection when no bottom signal is recorded is due to both nonmetal inclusions and to various grain sizes, as well as the predominant orientation of the grains and the fact that the grains are nonequiaxed. These factors should be allowed for during the ultrasonic quality inspection of steel articles that have a polycrystalline structure; their contribution to the result will be investigated in our future works.

The project has been running for more than ten years as part of the Cancer Genome Project (CGP) at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in the UK. The data in COSMIC are curated from a variety of sources, primarily the scientific literature and large international consortia. The project includes information from the CGP, along with data from other consortia such as the International Cancer Genome Consortium and The Cancer Genome Atlas. In addition, COSMIC is regularly updated with the genes highlighted in the Cancer Gene Census, which curates the scientific literature for known cancer genes [2]. With the advent of whole exome and genome sequencing technology, the amount of data in COSMIC is increasing rapidly. The recent COSMIC release (version 53; 18 May 2011) contains 608,042 tumor and cell line samples, annotating 176,856 mutations across 19,439 genes, with 352 full exomes, 43 whole genome rearrangement screens and 4 full genomes now available. The data are updated regularly, with new releases scheduled every two months. COSMIC provides a large number of graphical and tabular views for interpreting and mining the large quantity of information, as well as the facility to export the relevant data in various formats. The website can be navigated in many ways to examine mutation patterns on the basis of genes, samples and phenotypes, which are the main entry points to COSMIC. COSMIC also provides various options to browse the data in a genomic context. Integration with the Ensembl genome browser allows the visualization of full genome annotations, together with COSMIC data, on the GRCh37 genome coordinates. COSMIC also contains its own genome browser, which facilitates data analysis by combining genome-wide gene structures and sequences with rearrangement breakpoints, copy number variations and all somatic substitutions, deletions, insertions and complex gene mutations. The main COSMIC website [1] encompasses all of the available data. However, within COSMIC, the Cancer Cell Line Project [3] is a specialized component, which provides details of the genotyping of almost 800 commonly used cancer cell lines, through the set of known cancer genes. Its focus is to identify driver mutations, or those likely to be implicated in the oncogenesis of each tumor. This information forms the basis for integrating COSMIC with the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer project [4], which is a joint effort with the Massachusetts General Hospital [5] to screen this panel of cancer cell lines against potential anticancer therapeutic compounds to investigate correlations between somatic mutations and drug sensitivity. Data on somatic mutations in cancer are being produced at a rapidly increasing rate, and the combined analysis of large distributed datasets is becoming ever more difficult. However, COSMIC curates and standardizes this information in a single database, providing user-friendly browsing tools and analytical functions, thus ensuring its role as a key resource in human cancer genetics.

In the present study, we aimed to find additional disease-associated SNPs in the PSCA region and to explore their possible molecular function. Methods Based on information from the 1000 Genomes and HapMap 3 projects, we performed imputation analysis on 3,532 bladder cancer cases and 5,120 healthy controls of European ancestry from the stage 1 bladder cancer GWAS, within $\\pm 100 \\mathrm{~kb}$ of the region flanking the GWAS signal, rs2294008. The average allele dosage and best-quess genotypes were estimated and tested for association between SNP variants and bladder cancer risk by using unconditional logistic regression. Functional follow-up studies included RNA sequencing in normal and tumor bladder samples and electrophoretic mobility shift assays to examine the potentially altered DNAprotein interactions for SNPs of interest. Results A total of 639 imputed and 37 genotyped SNPs within $\\pm 100 \\mathrm{~kb}$ of the region of the original GWAS signal were tested for genetic association with bladder cancer. In these stage 1 GWAS samples, the SNP rs2294008 had a per-allele odds ratio (OR) of 1.09 ( $95 \\%$ confidence interval $(\\mathrm{Cl})=1.02$ to $1.16, P=6.9310^{-4}$ ). Multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusted for the study center, age, gender, smoking status and rs2294008 genotype revealed a novel associated variant, rs2978974 (OR $=1.11,95 \\% \\mathrm{Cl}=1.04$ to $1.19, P=$ $1.62 \\times 10^{-3}$ ). There was low linkage disequilibrium between rs2978974 and the original GWAS signal, rs2294008 $\\left(D^{*}=0.19, F^{*}=0.02\\right)$. Only individuals carrying the risk variant of both SNPs had an increased risk of bladder cancer $(\\mathrm{OR}=1.24,95 \\% \\mathrm{Cl}=1.13$ to $1.35, P=4.69 \\times 10^{-4}$ ) and not individuals who carried a risk variant of only one of the SNPs $(P>0.05)$. Stratified analysis suggested that this compound effect of rs2294008 and rs2978974 was more significant in males $\\left(\\mathrm{OR}=1.27, P=2.80 \\times 10^{-4}\\right)$ than in females $(\\mathrm{OR}=1.08$, $P=0.52$ ). rs2978974 resides $10 \\mathrm{~kb}$ upstream of rs2294008, is marked by an $\\mathrm{H} 3 \\mathrm{~K} 4 \\mathrm{me} 3$ signal and is in the vicinity of an androgen-receptor-binding site. Using RNA sequencing of bladder samples, we showed that rs2978974 is located within an alternative, untranslated first exon of PSCA.

                "value": " Taking both the radiometric data and geological setting into account, we consider that the stock is distinctly younger than the main massif, but is genetically related to it. Dacitic domes emplaced along ring fractures are characteristically the youngest of all rocks associated with the evolution of large calderas (Smith and Bailey, 1968) but in general they follow the main caldera-forming events in less than a million years. The extrusive Cerro Rico stock may have taken place rather longer after the formation of the caldera. EVOLUTION OF THE CALDERA COMPLEX The following history for the Kari Kari caldera is suggested: (1) An early episode of andesitic volcanism. (2) Intrusion of a large body of siliceous magma at shallow level. (3) Doming and fracturing of rocks above the intrusion. (4) Eruption of voluminous pyroclastic flows from ring fractures. (5) Formation of a 30-km-diameter caldera by collapse along ring fractures, possibly followed by further eruptions of pyroclastic flows which accumulate in the centre of the caldera. (6) Following cessation of the principal igneous activity, lacustrine volcanoclastic sediments of the Caracoles Formation are deposited within the caldera. (7) Continued intrusion of magma, causing resurgence of centre. (8) Interval of unknown duration; intrusion of Kumurana granodiorite. (9) Intrusion of rhyodacitic domes along the caldera ring fractures, of which the Cerro Rico stock is the only known relic. (10) Late-stage hydrothermal activity, responsible for alteration of many pyroclastic rocks, and the mineralization of the Cerro Rico stock. (11) Waning hydrothermal activity continues to the present day - hot springs are present at three points around the northern and eastern flanks of the batholith. While we consider that the geological evidence demonstrates that there is a direct link between the formation of the Kari Kari caldera and the intrusion of the Cerro Rico stock, in other areas of rhyolitic volcanism the links between mineralisation and caldera formation are less direct. In such areas, the ring fractures and related zones of weakness created during an early cycle of caldera collapse and resurgence have evidently provided a structural framework governing the emplacement of later mineralisation associated with a magmatic episode not genetically related to that which produced the caldera. For example, Mid to Late Tertiary base and precious metal vein deposits in the San Juan Mountains of Colorado are considered by Lipman et al. (1976) to have been structurally localised by calderas of mid-Tertiary age and similar phenomena have also been described by Ashley (1974) from the epithermal gold-silver district in Nevada and by Elston (1978) in New Mexico. Although the area around Potosi has been of interest for decades because of its economic importance, much remains to be learned about the igneous rocks and their volcanic relationships.

                "value": " This is particularly true for steroid hormones, which have different effects on different cells at different stages of differentiation. Using various models of osteoblastic cells, we found several examples which may represent phenotype specific hormonal responses. Retinoic acid (RA) suppresses alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in osteoblastic (OB) cells, but stimulates ALP in pre-OB cells. Only in pre OB cells, RA upregulates the early gene egrl, via a single retinoic acid response element (RE) halfsite, which we identified in the egrl promoter. Dexamethasone (DEX) stimulates osteopontin (OP) in pre-OB and not in OB cells. This effect appears to be mediated by a short sequence in the OP promoter, which is not a glucocorticoid $R E$ but a variant of the binding site for the nuclear factor SPI. Other examples, which we have not characterized at the promoter level, include estrogen upregulation of IGF1 mRNA, observed in calvariaderived $\\mathrm{OBs}$ but not in fibroblasts, and stimulation by $1,25(\\mathrm{OH})_{2} \\mathrm{D}_{3}$ of thromboin receptor in mouse $\\mathrm{OBs}$, but not in fibroblasts. The tissue-specific steroid hormone effects are most likely due to the presence of nuclear factors, which co-regulate transcription. A bone cell specific transcription factor, analagous to myogenin, has not yet been identified. It is possible that tissue specificity is conferred by a given combination of more ubiquitous factors such as egrl, fos, SPI, etc. 9. The mechanism of bone induction and bone healing by human osteosarcoma cell extracts HC Anderson, HHT Hsu, TR Hunt, P Rava, JR Schwappach, DC Morris, DJ Schneider University KS Medical Center, Kansas City, KS 66160 USA Saos-2 cultured human osteosarcoma cells contain a CuHClextractable bone-inducing agent (BIA) which can induce heterotopic bone in the muscle of $\\mathrm{Nu} / \\mathrm{Nu}$ mice. A semi-purified $\\mathrm{GuHCl}$ extract of Saos-2 cells also can promote healing and complete bony union in otherwise non-healing, surgicallyinduced defects of rat femur. We hypothesize that Saos-2 cells contain a complete admixture of molecules that must interact in order to induce bone (including one or more of the BMPs) plus other as yet unrecognized but necessary cofactor(s). Northern blot analyses indicate expression of mRNAs for BMP-2, 3, 4 and TGF $\\beta$ in both the Sacs-2 cells and in non-osteolinductive U20S human osteosarcoma cells. Therefore, the presence of BMPs alone and/or TGF $\\beta$ does not fully explain Sacs-2s bone-inducing ability and we expect to find additional undiscovered osteoinductive cofactors in Sacs-2 cells. Although BIA-induced heterotopic bones have half-lives of only a few weeks, the reparative bone induced by BIA in femoral defects gives every indication of being permanent and self-sustaining. This suggests a fundamental difference between heterotopic and orthotopic osteoprogenitor cells with those arising from the marrow stroma more closely resembling the \"determined\" osteoprogenitor cells of Friedenstein. Supported by NIH grant DE05262 10. Osteoprogenitor cells: what are they and what do they respond to? Van Vlasselaer $P$ VITO Department Environment, Division Biology, Boeretagg 200, 2400 Mol, Belgium Murine bone marrow synthesizes alkaline phosphatase (ALP), collagen type I and osteocalcin and mineralizes when cultured in the presence of $\\beta$-glycerophosphate and vitamin $C$. Cells responsible for these phenomena occur at frequencies of $1 / 2 \\times 105$ and $1 / 1.7 \\times 104$ cells in marrow from untreated and 5 Fluorouracil treated mice, respectively. Osteogenic activity requires TGF- $\\beta$ since bone protein synthesis and mineralization was inhibited in cultures treated with anti-TGF- $\\beta$ blocking mAb's (ID11.16). This suppressive effect was only observed when ID11.16 was added before the tenth day of culture. Thus TGF- $\\beta$ acts before increase in cell proliferation and ALP expression occurs. Comparable observations were made in cultures treated with IL-10 which suppresses TGF- $\\beta$ synthesis at the mRNA and protein level. In contrast to their suppressive effect, IL-10 and ID11.16 induced haematopoiesis in osteogenic cell cultures. TGF- $\\beta$ appears to regulate the commitment of undifferentiated cells towards either osteogenic activity or haematopoietic support. Fluorescence activated cell sorting showed that marrow derived osteogenic cells display a high forward and perpendicular light scatter. Whereas these cells express the Sc1, KM16, Sab-1 and Sab-2 surface antigens and bind intensely to wheat germ agglutinin, they do not express the c-kit surface antigen. Sorted osteoprogenitor cells synthesize bone proteins and mineralize in primary cultures but lose this potency upon subcultivation. 11. Differentiation of pericytes along the osteogenic pathway AM Schor, AE Cafield, AJ Sutton, BI Lord* CRC Departments of Medical Oncology and \"Experimental Haematology, P1CR, Christie Hospital NHS Trust, Manchester, M20 9BX, UK Pericytes are defined in vivo by their location; embedded within the basement membrane of microvessels. They form, therefore, an integral part of the microvascular wall and are believed to participate in angiogenesis, although their precise role is not clear. Pericytes derived from the retinal microvasculature have been cultured and identified by a series of phenotypic characteristics that clearly distinguishes them from other stromal cells such as smooth muscle cells. Pericytes respond to angiogenic factors and can display an angiogenic phenotype in vitro. Angiogenesis is commonly associated with mineralisation. Pericytes in vitro differentiate into an osteogenic phenotype, defined by the deposition of a mineralised extracellular matrix. This pericyte differentiation is further characterised by (a) alterations in the response to TGF $\\beta 1$ and (b) changes in the synthesis and/or deposition of various extracellular matrix proteins such as laminin, type IV collagen, tenascin, type $X$ collagen and osteonectin. We have examined pericyte differentiation using various growth-modifying factors and found that mineralisation of pericyte cultures can be prevented under specific conditions. These data support the hypothesis that pericytes represent primitive mesenchymal cells in the adult. 12. Is collagenase (matrix-metalloproteinase-1) necessary for bone remodelling? S Krane Harvard Medical School, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston MA 02114, USA In physiological remodelling of bone and other connective tissues, proteinases, such as the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) which can cleave type I collagen, play a critical role. Among the MMPs, only the collagenases (MMP-1 and MMP-8) cleave native, denatured collagen at $\\mathrm{pH}-7$. In bone, MMP-1 is secreted principally by stromal fibroblasts and osteoblasts. The cleavage is site specific, at a single locus in the $\\alpha 1(1)$ chain between Gly775-11er76. We have altered the amino acid sequences around the collagenase cleave site by site-directed mutagenesis of the murine Colla1 gene, introducing Pro for Gln774, Pro for Ala77 and Met for Ile776. In our previous studies, the mutant Colla1 gene was expressed in Mov 13 fibroblasts and secreted type I collagen molecules were found to be resistant to cleavage at Gly775-Iler76 by MMP-1 or MMP-8 (H Wy, M byrme, A Stacey, M Coldring, J Birkhead, R Jaenisch, S Krane, 1990. PNAS 87: 5888-5892). In order to determine the role of collagenase in vivo, this mutation has recently been introduced into the endogenous Colla1 gene by homologous"

THE debate on the London Water Bill did not reach a very high level, and not one of the speakers apparently realised the importance of the matter from the point of view of the interests of the people of London. Mr. Long contented himself with formally moving the second reading of the Bill. In this he was wise. Mr. Buxton accused the Government of trying to get away as far as possible from the principle of direct representation in the election of the Water Board and lauded the County Council; but Sir John Dorington, one of the members of the Llandaff Commission, pointed out that the London County Council was out of court because it did not govern the district which was to be supplied with water, but only a part of it ; that, moreover, the outside authorities strongly objected to be placed under the administration of the London County Council ; and, finally, that severance of the supply in bulk (as proposed by the latter authority as an alternative scheme) had been clearly shown to be impracticable. These matters are familiar to our readers, but they appeared to be new to the House of Commons. Sir John Dorington criticised the Government proposal to create a Board of such an enormous size. He very tightly emphasised the point that in the case of purchase it would be much better if the administration of the Water Board could begin its work piece by piece. This is a most important point. If the Board were elected truly to represent the water consumers, and had the option of purchasing the businesses instead of being compelled to do so, the chief objections of fair-minded people to the present Bill would disappear. Mr. Boulnois and Colonel Lockwood, both water-company directors, made speeches calculated to enhance the value of the undertakings. They could do no less. Mr. Mellor, who was a member of the Llandaff Commission, criticised the unwieldiness of the proposed Water Board and appeared to think that if a purchase of the undertakings were made under the provisions of the Lands Causes Act all would go well and that everyone would be satisfied-the London County Council, the representatives of the water companies, and even \"the London ratepayer whose interests ought to be considered in so important a matter as this.\" The London ratepayers should be grateful to Mr. Mellor for his kind thought. At any rate, he does not, as everyone else in this difficult question seems to do, ignore the fact that the people who have to pay the bill and drink the water deserve consideration. But if the ratepayers knew all the facts we cannot believe that they would agree with Mr. Mellor. On the contrary, they would see that they can hardly do otherwise than lose heavily in a financial way should they be bluffed or cajoled into allowing the Government Bill to pass, especially with the improvements of Mr. Mellor and the water company directors incorporated. Sir John Maple criticised the Bill from a financial standpoint, and evidently did not consider that the Water Board as constituted under the Bill would include proper persons to fix the price to be paid for the companies' undertakings. Mr. Asquith declared for the London County Council as par excellence the proper water authority for London. Therefore he condemned the Bill entirely. His speech, coming from an eminent jurist and an ex-Home Secretary, cannot fail to be damaging to the Bill, even though it does not convert many members of the House of Commons to his estimate of the London County Council's claims. Mr. Walter Long with refreshing complacency decided that the Government must have struck the fair middle path because the measure was so opposed at either extreme. On the one hand the Government was told that the measure would be a grievous burden to the ratepayers, and on the other hand the water companies were protesting their forlorn condition under its provisions. The Bill was then read a second time, and after further debate was referred to a Joint Committee of both Houses. A SUCCESSFUL IMPOSTOR. Charles William Burrows, who was sentenced by Mr. Justice Bucknill to seven years' penal servitude at the Liverpool assizes, seems to have had a surprisingly prosperous career during the last few years, and as he was able to make members of the medical profession his especial victims the history of his crimes is worth recounting in our columns. He was at one time apprentice to a chemist in Tottenham Court-road, and as such he is stated to have had charge of branch establishments. Making friends with medical students he attended lectures, apparently posing as a medical student himself, and in this character he acquired some knowledge of surgery. For a period after this he lived by his wits and otherwise, now playing in a theatrical orchestra, now travelling with a theatrical company, and now introducing to Brighton audiences a bullet-proof coat. In 1898 he seems first to have thought of turning his medical and surgical experience to advantage by purchasing a practice, and his subsequent actions were ascribed by his counsel at his trial to his failure to gratify this ambition, when a medical man who had promised to advance the necessary money declined to complete the transaction on discovering that the prospective borrower was not qualified to practise. In spite, however, of the drawback of impecuniosity he nearly won success by ingenuity. He assumed the name of Mr. James Joseph O'Donnell which appears in the Medical Register and had, it seems, no difficulty in obtaining temporary employment as a locum-tement at Wigan. While there he learnt that a medical practitioner at Hindley wanted to sell his practice, and no doubt the fact of his being at the moment locum-tement to a medical man strengthened his hand for his next move. The gentleman to whom he introduced himself at Hindley agreed to sell him his house for $£ 1600$ and his practice for $£ 750$, and he obtained from a third person on the strength of this transaction $£ 75$ in cash, to be expended on the purchase of furniture, as well as a horse and carriage from the vendor of the practice."

                "value": " The effectiveness of a filler depends on its characteristics, such as particle size and shape and, more significantly, on the strength of polymer-filler interactions. To achieve maximum improvement, strong fibre interaction with the polymeric matrix will be needed because the interface/interphase between fibre and matrix has a large influence on the mechanical properties of the composite. These interactions may also increase the effective degree of crosslinking and such an effect is particularly strong if the particles have some reactive surface groups [2]. A great deal of effort has been directed towards ensuring that the fibre-matrix interface can transfer the stresses efficiently, so that the properties achieved by reinforcing are maintained and not degraded by the environment. The use of coupling agents, i.e. substances chemically reactive with both matrix and reinforcement, and/or chemical modification of the surface of one or more constituents, have been the most successful means of providing reasonably well controlled bond between matrix and the encapsulated reinforcement. The rapid growth of using multiphase polymer systems (blends and composites) is undoubtedly related to the availability of methods of controlling the physical and chemical interactions at the interface. Compounds acting as interfacial agents are commonly known as \"compatibilizers\" in blends, or \"coupling agents\" in composites, and their function is to promote interfacial adhesion and enhance overall properties [3]. In general, compatibilizers reduce interfacial tension and, therefore, are capable of promoting adhesion leading to a finely dispersed morphology that shows stability against gross segregation. Compatibilizers are often based on polyolefins functionalized with acrylic acid [4], maleic anhydride [5] or other thermoplastics with polar groups such as ionomers [6]. 2 Current Trends in Interphase Modification and Compatibilization of Rubbers Rubbers, also called elastomers, are high molecular weight materials which possess very low interchain force, low glass transition temperature, $\\mathrm{T}_{\\mathrm{g}}$, and predominantly amorphous nature with low strength. The common characteristics of rubbers are their elasticity, flexibility and toughness and their commercial grades can be classified into two types: crosslinked systems and thermoplastic elastomers. Most of the commonly used rubbers are polymeric materials with long chains, which are chemically crosslinked during the curing process. These materials, once formed, cannot be reshaped, softened, melted nor reprocessed by a simple subsequent reheating. Thermoplastic elastomers, on the other hand, are rubbers which act at room temperature in a manner similar to crosslinking materials but are copolymers, with one phase being rubbery and the other crystallizable. Therefore, they can repeatedly shaped upon heating [7]. Rubbers are often compounded with reinforcing fillers to improve their mechanical properties, such as tensile strength,"

This has allowed qualitative and quantitative preliminary assessments of how these patients deviate from healthy controls in their judgements of facial emotional expressions. The greatest deviation for the patients occurred for faces displaying negative emotions, particularly fear. Negative emotion expressions seemed more neutral than those from healthy subjects. This may suggest that patients have a wider or less consistent concept of face emotions, especially negative face emotions. XIII.F. Pharmacologic effects on cognition XIII.F.1 ANTISACCADE, EXECUTIVE AND CLINICAL MEASURES IN SCHIZOPHRENIA ARE UNAFFECTED BY ACUTE 5HT2A/2C ANTAGONISM USING CYPROHEPTADINE I.B. Chaudhry, S.D. Soni, J.S.E. Hellewell and J.F.W. Deakin University of Manchester Dept of Psychiatry, Rawnsley Building, Manchester Royal Infirmary, Manchester M14, U.K. We have reported that fenfluramine enhancement of $5 \\mathrm{HT} 2$ neurotransmission impairs frontal motor executive functions. Antagonism of 5HT2 receptors, by improving frontal lobe function, may mediate the beneficial effects of clozapine on negative symptoms. To test this idea, we investigated the effects on neuropsychological, clinical and oculomotor function of a single dose of the $5 \\mathrm{HT} 2 \\mathrm{~A} / 2 \\mathrm{C}$ antagonist, cyproheptadine $(20 \\mathrm{mg})$, in a group of 18 chronic schizophrenic patients, using a double blind placebo controlled crossover design. Cyproheptadine had no effect on any neuropsychological (Stroop, verbal fluency, Wisconsin card sort, Trail making, memory) or clinical measure, although subjects were better than chance in identifying the active drug, indicating adequate absorbtion. Performance on the tests of executive function was correlated with the antisaccade error rate, suggesting the involvement of a common frontal abnormality. The mean antisaccade error rate was $44 \\%$ and was not influenced by the drug. The results suggest that the impairments in executive and antisaccade eye movement function seen in schizophrenia may reflect a hard wired impairment, which is not modulated by $5 \\mathrm{HT} 2 \\mathrm{~A} / \\mathrm{C}$ receptors. However, it is possible that longer term treatment with this or more selective antagonists might be necessary to release frontal lobe function. XIII.F.2 COGNITIVE DYSFUNCTION IN SCHIZOPHRENIA: A COMPARISON OF THE IMPACT OF ZOTEPINE VERSUS CLOZAPINE ON THE SYNDROM (A DOUBLE BLIND TRIAL)  B. Gallhofer, J. Ulferts, U. Bauer and H. Gruppe  Centre for Psychiatry. School of Medicine, Justus Liebig University, Giessen, Germany Apart from positive, negative and affective symptoms, cognitive impairment in schizophrenia is known to be a major obstacle to therapeutic success. Two different-and distinctsources are thought to contribute to the fourth syndrome of schizophrenia. They are the illness itself and pharmacotherapy. It could, however, be demonstrated that clozapine (CLOZ) may reverse such disturbances. Because of its complexity assessment of cognitive function has remained difficult in the classification of schizophrenic symptoms. A series of neuropsychological tests was designed in Giessen/ Germany to determine and compare the spectre of cognitive performance both in healthy volunteers and schizophrenic subjects. The aim was to distinguish and quantify the impact of the illness and the effects of antipsychotic substances. Because of the relative success of CLOZ $5 \\mathrm{HT}_{2}$ blockade has been widely regarded as one of the possible properties of novel antipsychotic agents for cognitive improvement. Zotepine (ZOT) is an even more strongly $5 \\mathrm{HT}_{2}$ weighted tricyclic substance due to which such clinical effects have been recently described. Two matched groups of schizophrenic patients (ZOT $=11, \\mathrm{CLOZ}=11$ ) were studied in a double blind trial. They were compared to 10 healthy volunteers (CON). All three groups had been investigated during a period of 42 days. The test battery consisted of a cortical-subcortical visuomotor maze task (MAZE) and an auditory time discrimination task (ATD) with a perceptive (ms) and a cognitive (s) component. Results of this investigation demonstrate marked cognitive deficits in untreated schizophrenic patients in all tasks. Shortterm results show no marked difference between the CLOZ and ZOT, but outcome after 42 days favours ZOT in some aspects: In the auditory discrimination test task-related focussing is more impaired in the CLOZ group especially in the perceptive component where ZOT-treated patients cease to differ from CON while subjects on CLOZ differ from both CON and ZOT. In MAZE subcortical control in the prefrontal component also favours ZOT slightly. Findings from the study therefore suggest that substances with a higher $5 \\mathrm{HT}_{2 \\mathrm{~A}}$ component are more likely to improve cognitive impairment in schizophrenia."

An indirect condition is illustrated by the following schematic example: suppose that $c$ causes $f$ and $f$ causes $e$, so that $f$ is a direct condition of the causal connection between $c$ and $e$. Now we have asserted that'$a$ causes $b$'entails that there exists a set of conditioning circumstances to this causal relation. In the case of'$c$ causes $f$ ', suppose that the condition of this causal relation is $g$, where $g$ is not identical to $e. g$ then will qualify as an indirect condition of the causal connection between $c$ and $e$, via its direct conditioning relation to $c$'s causal connection to $f$ and $f$'s direct conditioning relation to $c$'s causal connection to $e$. Thus we have the following definition: $\\left(D_{2}\\right) g$ is an indirect condition of a causal connection between $c$ and $e$ if and only if $g$ is a direct condition of a causal connection between some direct condition $f$, of a causal connection between $c$ and $e$, and either $c$ or $e.{ }^{17}$ An example of an indirect condition would be the following: Suppose that pressure from a hand on a piece of material results in the compression of the material. In turn, the compression of the material makes possible the transmission of pressure to a button. The compression of the material is a direct condition of the causal connection between the hand pressure and the depression of the button. The hand pressure compresses the material, we may suppose, only given the presence of water. The presence of water is a direct condition of the causal connection between the hand pressure and the compression of the material, and, thus, and indirect condition of the causal connection between the hand pressure and the depression of the button. One further point must be made before defining 'causally prior'. If $f$ is a condition of a causal connection between $c$ and $e$ and it is the case that $c$ causes $e$, then $f$ is a cause of $e$. Consider again the example of the scratching of the match which causes the match to ignite in the presence of oxygen. The presence of oxygen counts as a cause of the fire. Whether or not the presence of oxygen would be properly counted as \"the\" cause of the fire is not at issue, but its causal relevance cannot legitimately be denied. The same causal relevance is evidenced in all cases of direct conditions of a causal connection between $c$ and $e$; i.e., the direct condition is a cause of the effect event in the causally connected pair. Given this conclusion about direct conditions, the causal relevance of indirect condi- \\footnotetext{ ${ }^{17} \\mathrm{An}$ indirect condition may fail to be a direct condition of that which it indirectly conditions. If $g$, the indirect condition, had not occurred, $f$ may still have occurred, and thus $c$ and $e$ would have been causally connected. }"

Maronpot, ARnold Greenwell,  AND FRANK HARRINGTON  National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, P.O. Box 12233,  Research Triangle Park, North Carolina 27709 }  Interactions between Bromobenzene Dose, Glutathione Concentrations, and Organ Toxicities in Single- and Multiple-Treatment Studies. Kluwe, W. M., Maronpot, R. R., Greenwell, A., AND HARRINGTON, F. (1984). Fundam. Appl. Toxicol. 4, 1019-1028. A single oral dose of $4.0 \\mathrm{mmol} / \\mathrm{kg}$ bromobenzene transiently depleted hepatic and renal reduced nonprotein sulfhydryl group (NPS) concentrations, caused hepatocellular necrosis, and increased serum glutamicpyruvic transaminase activity in male Fischer 344 rats. The depletion of NPS had partially reversed by $24 \\mathrm{hr}$, and NPS concentrations were approximately twice normal values by $48 \\mathrm{hr}$ post-treatment. When the effects of single and repeated (once daily for 2, 4, or 10 days) treatments with $4.0 \\mathrm{mmol} / \\mathrm{kg}$ were compared, it was apparent that the severity of hepatotoxicity lessened and the percentage depletions of hepatic and renal NPS concentrations decreased with increasing length of bromobenzene treatment. There were essentially no signs of toxicity following the tenth treatment with $4.0 \\mathrm{mmol} / \\mathrm{kg}$. Single-treatment studies indicated the following dose-response: $2.0 \\mathrm{mmol} / \\mathrm{kg}$ bromobenzene depleted liver NPS and was hepatotoxic, $0.5 \\mathrm{mmol} /$ $\\mathrm{kg}$ caused a lesser depletion of liver NPS and was not (overtly) hepatotoxic, and $0.0625 \\mathrm{mmol} /$ $\\mathrm{kg}$ was the maximum dose that did not deplete liver NPS. The responses to single and multiple (ten) treatments with these representative doses were compared. Liver injury was observed after a single but not alter the tenth daily treatment with $2.0 \\mathrm{mmol} / \\mathrm{kg}$. Both the single and the tenth administrations of $2.0 \\mathrm{mmol} / \\mathrm{kg}$ depleted hepatic NPS, but the precentage of depletion was greater after the first than after the tenth dose. Liver injury was not detected with lower dose regimens. The patterns of NPS depletion in liver and kidney were similar after single or muliple (ten) treatments. The minimum NPS concentrations produced, however, were lower after single than after multiple treatments. The molar amounts of liver NPS depleted after the tenth treatment appeared to be equivalent to or greater than those after the first, but prior bromobenzene exposure resulted in a higher concentration of tissue NPS being present at the time of the final treatment. Thus, the minimum tissue concentrations of NPS were greater after multiple treatments than after single treatments, despite the loss of equivalent amounts of NPS. It is concluded from these studies that repeated treatment produces resistance to bromobenzene hepatotoxicity. This protective adaptation may be due to a chemically induced increase in liver glutathione concentration. (c) 1984 Society of Toxicology.  It is a well-accepted practice in toxicity testing to choose doses for subchronic and chronic animal studies on the basis of doseresponse in preceding acute and subchronic studies (Sontag et al., 1976; Food Safety Council, 1980; Robens et al., 1982). This methodology assumes that animals become no less susceptible and, in fact, may become more susceptible to chemical toxicity upon \\footnotetext{ ${ }^{1}$ To whom correspondence should be addressed. } repeated exposure. As our knowledge of mechanisms of chemical toxicity expands, however, the importance of such modulating factors as age, environmental factors, concomitant chemical exposures, and induction or inhibition of xenobiotic metabolism on the toxic response must be considered in toxicity testing. Several chemicals are believed to become proximate toxicants following metabolism to electrophilic intermediates. Many of these"

This whole question has been well considered by the above writers and others, and by the courts, and may now be regarded as settled. In Cumberland v. Codrington (1817), 3 Johns. Ch. 229, Chancellor KenT states the proposition, a statement which has generally been adopted by the American courts. It is interesting to note that the principal case as it is presented here could scarcely arise in England, where we find a statutory provision providing that all incumbrances upon land devised are made a primary charge upon the land itself, and the land is not entitled to exoneration out of the personal estate without an \"expression of intention\" to that effect. This statute, although enacted more than fifty years ago, ( 17 \\& 18 Vict. Ch. II3), has not met with great favor in this country. The theory of the common law rule, which is the modern American rule, is that the personal estate when receiving the benefit should bear the burden of an encumbrance, and it is excused from exoneration only when not so benefitted. This rule manifestly has reason and justice supporting it, and the benefits to be had by an adoption of the Statute of Victoria do not impress us. For a view of the law contrary to that announced in the principal case see the opinion of Judge Woodward in Hoff's Appeal, 24 Pa. 200, 203; 4 Gray's Cas. Prop. 635.

                "value": " The CS24 antiserum has been analyzed by the new technique of immuno-autoradiography on SDS gels. As far as we know, this is the first time an unknown antiserum has been analyzed in this way. Two major antigens with molecular weights of $56,000( \\pm 1500)$ and $30,000( \\pm 1500)$ daltons were identified in gels of both $3 T 3$ cells and the gerbil fibroma cells. The 56,000 dalton band would seem to correspond to the major subunit of the intermediate filaments recently isolated from fibroblasts (Starger and Goldman, 1977). It may also correspond to that isolated from calf brain (neurofilament protein) 54,000-56,000 daltons molecular weight (Yen et al., 1976), the 58,000 dalton molecular weight \"tonofilament\" protein of newborn rat epidermis (Brysk, Gray and Bernstein, 1977), and possibly the $50,000-55,000$ dalton molecular weight subunit protein (\"desmin\" or \"skeletin\") from smooth muscle intermediate filaments (Cooke, 1976; Lazarides and Hubbard, 1976; Small and Sobieszek, 1977). The 30,000 dalton molecular weight band identified as an antigen by the CS24 antiserum does not correspond to any major band claimed as a subunit by those working on the biochemistry of intermediate filaments. It cannot be ruled out that the 30,000 dalton molecular weight protein is not a proteolytic fragment of the 56,000 dalton component. We think that this is improbable, since in some experiments, the protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride has been included in the gel sample buffer, and in all experiments, the time to dissolve the cells in sample buffer was very brief, between 1-2 min from adding the sample buffer to placing the samples in a boiling water bath. Alternatively, it could be that this is an irrelevant secondary antigen unrelated to intermediate filaments, but against which this rabbit was also reactive. Yet the immunofluorescent patterns obtained on these cultured fibroblasts were remarkably clean, with little reacting besides this filament system. It may well be, therefore, that this 30,000 dalton protein is also a component of the intermediate filaments within these cells. In support of this possibility, we note that Starger and Goldman (1977) used two procedures to purify intermediate filaments from BHK cells. Their primary method used colchicine to induce perinuclear \"caps\" of intermediate filaments which were then isolated, but similar \"caps\" were also isolated from spreading cells. When gels of the filaments prepared by the two procedures were compared (Figure 4 of Starger and Goldman, 1977) the most prominent difference was the appearance of a band at about 30,000 daltons (by our estimation) in the preparation of filaments from spreading cells-that is, in the preparation from which colchicine was omit- ted. It could well be that our lower molecular weight antigen corresponds to this band on their gel, and that this is a secondary component of intermediate filaments that is separated from the core of the filaments during their purification in the presence of colchicine. If further work substantiates this, it would raise the interesting possibility that this 30,000 dalton protein may form some sort of interacting link between the systems of intermediate filaments and microtubules. Recently two other groups have described autoimmune antisera which react with similar filament systems. Osborn et al. (1977) found that 28 rabbits out of 30 tested contained antibodies that reacted with a filament system in PtK2 cells. Although the filament system they describe has similarities to the one we describe, such as its response to colcemid and cytochalasin treatment, they report a major difference in that their antigen is destroyed by formaldehyde fixation. The staining pattern given the CS24 by our antiserum is unaffected by the presence or absence of formaldehyde fixation. We have also found that the antisera from some other rabbits have given similar immunofluorescent patterns to the one we describe here, but the frequency we have found has been lower than that described by Osborn et al. (1977). Until the antigen(s) reactive with their antiserum is determined, it is difficult to make a comparison. It may be that their antiserum is reacting with a different component of the same filament system. An analogy from the system of actin microfilaments is that antibodies against filamin and actin, two very different antigens, both stain the microfilament bundles in a similar fashion [compare Wang et al. (1975) with Lazarides and Weber (1974)]. A similar autoimmune antiserum from certain human patients has been reported by Kurki et al. (1977). Again the identity of the antigenic polypeptides has not yet been determined. An important question concerning intermediate filaments is how closely related these structures are both biochemically and functionally from one cell type or tissue to another. With other structural proteins such as actin and myosin, multiple forms have been found (for actin, Garrels and Gibson, 1976; Storti and Rich, 1976; Whalen, ButterBrowne and Gros, 1976; Rubenstein and Spudich, 1977; for myosin, Burridge and Bray, 1975). Antisera can provide limited information on the relatedness of proteins, but they cannot prove identity. The CS24 antiserum described here reacts with the intermediate filaments of many cultured cell types, fibroblasts, macrophages and epithelial cells. It also stains filaments within neuroblastoma and has been used to stain filaments within the axons and cell bodies of cultured neurons from"

The charge interactions between the acidic residue in the middle of the Cys-loop region and a basic residue the extreme carboxyl terminus of the LBD, just before the transmembrane domain also appear be universal features that might be involved in the process of channel gating. On the basis of the domain architectures and operon organizations, we predict that the bacterial ARTLGICs are likely to function as chemoreceptors for lowmolecular-weight solutes in the environment. Phyletic and phylogenetic analyses suggest that the ancestor of the animal lineage probably acquired a single progenitor from a bacterial source, and it subsequently radiated to give rise to all the Cysloop receptor subunits of the extant metazoans. Materials and methods The nonredundant (NR) database of protein sequences (National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)) was searched using the BLASTP program [49]. Unfinished microbial and eukaryotic genomes were searched using the TBLASTN program with protein queries [49]. Iterative database searches were conducted using the PSI-BLAST program with either a single sequence or an alignment used as the query, with a position-specific score matrix inclusion expectation (E) value threshold of 0.01 (unless specified otherwise); the searches were iterated until convergence [49]. For all searches with compositionally biased proteins, the statistical correction for this bias was used. Multiple alignments were constructed using the T_Coffee [22] or PCMA programs [22], followed by manual correction based on the PSI-BLAST results and structural information. All large-scale sequenceanalysis procedures were carried out using the SEALS package [50]. Transmembrane regions were predicted in individual proteins using TMPRED [51], TMHMM2.0 [52] and TopPred II [53] with default parameters. For TopPred, the organism parameter was set to 'prokaryote' or 'eukaryote' depending on the source of the protein. Signal peptides were predicted using the SIGNALP program [54]. Protein structure manipulations were performed using the Swiss-PDB viewer program [55]. Protein secondary structure was predicted using a multiple alignment as the input for PHD [20] or JPRED2 [21]. Similarity-based clustering of proteins was carried out using BLASTCLUST [56]. Phylogenetic analysis was carried out using the maximumlikelihood, neighbor-joining, Bayesian inference and minimum evolution (least squares) methods. The MrBayes program was used for the Bayesian inference of phylogeny [57]. The alignment for phylogenetic analysis was prepared by visually deleting all those columns that contained non-conserved residues from five or fewer sequences. Regions with substantial gaps, which are replaced by numbers in Figure 1, were also entirely deleted from the alignment. The resulting alignment with 49 sequences and 368 columns was used for all subsequent phylogenetic analysis. Maximum-likelihood distance matrices were constructed with the TreePuzzle 5 program [58] using 1,000 replicates generated from the input alignment and used as the input for construction of neighborjoining trees with the Weighbor program [59]. Weighbor uses a weighted neighbor-joining tree construction procedure that has been shown to correct effectively for long-branch effects. The minimal evolution trees were constructed using the FITCH program [60] of the Phylip package on 1,000 bootstrap replicates prepared from the input sequence. For maximum-likelihood analysis two different procedures were used. In the first, a minimum evolution tree obtained using FITCH was provided as a input for the Protml program [61,62], which then produced a maximum-likelihood tree using local rearrangements. The statistical significance of the internal nodes of this maximum-likelihood tree was assessed using the relative estimate of logarithmic likelihood bootstrap (Protml RELL-BP) [61,62], with 10,000 replicates. In the second procedure an initial full maximum likelihood tree was constructed using the Proml program of the Phylip package [60]. A gamma distribution with one invariant and four variable sites with different rates was used for constructing this tree, which was then used as the guide tree to generate further full maximum-likelihood trees using the PhyML program with 100 bootstrap replicates generated from the input alignment [63]. The consensus of these 100 trees was derived using the Consense program of the Phylip package to obtain the bootstrapped full maximum-likelihood tree. Gene neighborhoods were determined by searching the NCBI PTT tables with a custom-written script. These tables can be accessed from the genomes division of the Entrez retrieval system.

At the present time it is stretching the point considerably even to suggest a relationship between reflux and spontaneous pneumothorax. Nevertheless, in the patients with pneumothorax seen within the last year, $100 \\%$ have had easily demonstrable gastroesophageal reflux when it was looked for, and have also had symptoms of esophagitis when questioned. Our position regarding recurrent hemoptysis as being due to aspiration (chemical) bronchitis is on more firm footing. Approximately 19 of our patients in the present series presented with hemoptysis. After the usual careful studies, only reflux and the typical (nonspecific) endoscopic findings of chemical bronchitis were found. Only 1 of these patients has had any hemoptysis at all since the Belsey repairs were performed, and this was in a very small amount that has progressively decreased as the follow-up has lengthened. We have approached this entire problem with the normal reluctance that accompanies acceptance of ideas from one's colleagues and with the caution that should accompany entry into an untried arena. Continued follow-up of our first 9 cases of hiatal hernia repair in infants and children for reflux without demonstrated hernia [5] reveals that all of those patients with an initial good result (8 out of 9) have continued to be free of symptoms. Continued follow-up of the original 9 children who were not operated on revealed persistence of their problem almost into pulmonary oblivion. Some of the results have been so dramatic that we could be fooled into thinking that our present approach leaves little to be desired.

However, we reserve the use of an internal stent for complicated cases, such as pyeloureterostomy in a duplicated system. CONCLUSIONS Our patients who underwent pyeloplasty using only a nephrostomy tube had few complications. Nephrostomy drainage not only serves as a potential protective mechanism from postoperative edema and prevents extravasation at the site of repair, but also allows easy access for radiographic study before tube removal. Furthermore, nephrostomy tube drainage does not prolong hospitalization and the tube may be easily removed on an outpatient basis without further anesthesia. REFERENCES 1. Ellsworth, P.

J Urol, 159: 2116, 1998 EDITORIAL COMMENT This issue has been on the minds of many pediatric urologists for a long time. Although this was not a prospective controlled study it provides the experience of the authors with nephrostomy tube drainage after pyeloplasty. The advantages and disadvantages are outlined and referenced in the discussion. It is true that there is a paucity of controlled prospective studies with age matched controls on the subject. Currently, devices such as the kidney internal splint/ stent serve the purpose of stenting the anastomosis while providing nephrostomy drainage. It is not possible to ensure anastomotic patency before tube withdrawal, as capping the tube directs urine into the distal ureter via the stent portion of the device. The issue of urinary diversion after pyeloplasty was addressed by Wollin et al (reference 13 in article). They reported that the morbidity was $10.5 \\%$ (infection) for nephrostomy drainage with a transanastomotic stent and $10.5 \\%$ (anastomotic leaks) for nonintubated repairs. Wollin et al concluded that a nephrostomy tube and stent appear to be unnecessary in routine pyeloplasty but could help to decrease the incidence of postoperative leakage in specific cases. In the present series nephrostomy drainage alone was associated with urinary tract infection in $1.5 \\%$ of the cases. Temporary ureteropelvic obstruction for more than 30 days occurred in $0.7 \\%$. Anastomotic leak for more than 7 days also occurred in $0.7 \\%$. Our earlier retrospective study revealed that there was no difference in short-term outcome whether a nephrostomy tube and/or stent was used after dismembered pyeloplasty (reference 11 in article). However, leakage occurred for about 1 week. The use of a ureteral stent adversely affected the long-term results possibly because red rubber catheters used at the time may have irritated healing tissues. For a number of years I used a perinephric Penrose drain as the only form of drainage after pyeloplasty. Wound drainage from anastomotic leaks can be prolonged in my experience. An occasional obstruction required either temporary internal stenting or percutaneous nephrostomy drainage. Currently, my preferred postoperative management of pyeloplasty consists of placing a $5 \\mathrm{Fr}$ feeding tube across the anastomosis and a small Malecot catheter to serve as a nephrostomy. A Penrose drain in the perinephric space helps to prevent ileus from possible extravasation of small amounts of urine. The feeding and nephrostomy tubes exit via the same incisions in the kidney and flank. The feeding tube is capped on the operating table and removed in 48 hours. Its purpose is to keep the anastomosis patent and prevent the possible coaptation of edematous tissues, which could theoretically form tissue bridges across the lumen, as can result from a \"dry\" anastomosis. On postoperative day 2 or 3 the nephrostomy tube is capped. The occurrence of pain, fever or urinary leak via the Penrose drain will determine whether the patient is discharged from the hospital with the tube capped or whether it will be connected to a small drainage bag. Reliable parents are provided with a catheter plug and have the option of attempting to cap the tube at home 2 days later. A nephrostogram is done at 1 week after pyeloplasty, at which time the nephrostomy tube and Penrose drain are removed. On rare occasions when anastomotic patency is not satisfactorily demonstrated, the nephrostomy tube is usually kept in place for another week. Patients are maintained on antibiotics until all tubes are removed and a urine culture is done just before removing the nephrostomy tube. Until such time as prospective randomized controlled age matched studies become available the issue of drainage after pyeloplasty will remain a matter of personal experience and preference. The issue of whether a Foley catheter in the bladder is truly helpful will also need to be addressed in such a study. Yves Homsy 5507 E Longboat Blvd. Tampa, Florida"

[To keep this department up-to-date and helpfully interesting, nurses in social work of every description and superintendents of district nursing associations are asked to put the address of its editor-104 South Michigan Avenue, Chicago-on their mailing files for items, clippings, and annual reports.] WITH the present spirit of co-operation abroad in the land, it is perhaps not surprising but still very gratifying to a visiting nurse association to receive requests to look up patients from out of town. Two such requests came recently from cities in Ohio to the Visiting Nurse Association of Chicago. One was from the superintendent of a large visiting nurse association, asking that one of its chronic patients, who had the good fortune to visit relatives in Chicago, be booked for a twice-a-week dressing which she could not possibly do herself. About two days after the letter was received, the patient herself telephoned to the office to leave her address and ask for a nurse. The trip was indeed a treat for the little old lady, and she could not have taken it had it not been for the foresight of her local visiting nurse and the work of the visiting nurses in the city of her relatives. The second letter for a nurse came from a laywoman in a town not possessing a visiting nurse association, but she evidently knew what they stand for. Her letter described the plight of a young couple, but recently removed to Chicago, who were expecting an increase in their family very shortly. The young woman was described as an \"ignorant young thing\" and much in need of instruction. She proved to be a scared little woman, very unprepared for her approaching trial, and most grateful for help and suggestions. Requests for the nurses' services come in daily from many unexpected local sources, but of late years the out-oftown calls have been increasing. By using Miss Waters' directory, nurses can find out about local associations in other cities and thus make sure that their patients are watched in their new homes. This is particularly important in the case of itinerant consumptives, who should not travel from state to state but who cannot be dissuaded from"

While it may be suitable for a some simulation applications it is not likely to be suitable for the type of simulation where the highest spatial resolution capabilities of the imaging UUT need to be evaluated. These are likely to form a major part of the test and evaluation procedures for which dynamic infrared scene projection systems are employed in the future. ${ }^{13}$ It is therefore advocated that the use of a 1:1 mapping procedure be limited to those applications where precise projector-to-UUT pixel array registration can be assured and where only relatively low spatial frequency content of the scene is needed for the specific UUT evaluation. The above recommendation leads inevitably towards a choice of greater than 1:1 pixel mapping ratio. The 4:1 mapping ratio based on Schade's original television imagery criterion represents a conservative starting point. There at least the spatial frequency information below Nyquist is transferred at satisfactory modulation efficiency, aliasing artifacts generated in the CIG subsystem are in most cases reduced to tolerable levels, and image field flatness is satisfactory. As has been shown by Legault ${ }^{9}$ and demonstrated by Park and Hazra, ${ }^{10}$ except in the special case where strong periodic behavior is present in the scene being projected, aliasing appears in the form of a signal-dependent noise that affects the appearance of the scene edges. The artifacts are localized within the vicinity of the edge and their appearance is governed by the strong phase variations that occur across the extent of the sampling pixel area. With the choice of the 4:1 mapping ratio the aliasing effects are suppressed in the sense that the noise-like behavior is determined by the projector pixel size. In area terms, this covers only a quarter of the UUT pixel. The effect of the aliasing, particularly of point sources and scene edges as discussed above, is therefore inevitably reduced compared to the 1:1 mapping case. 5. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS In this paper we have examined the subject of spatial filtering in the sampled imaging systems currently being developed for dynamic infrared scene projection applications. It has been shown that for a number of reasons a 1:1 mapping ratio between the projector and UUT pixels represents an undesirable choice. This supports the alternative of tending towards the conservative choice of a 4:1 mapping ratio. Spatial noise caused by projector array fabrication nonuniformity is reduced, the presence of dead projector pixels can be hidden from the UUT perspective, point source information can be projected in such a way that motion of the centroid is smooth and source brightness appears uniform irrespective of the position of the source in UUT pixel space and finally, the additional sources of spatial filtering and aliasing inevitably introduced by the presence of the CIG/projector subsystem can be reduced to tolerable levels. While the conservative application of the 4:1 mapping ratio is advocated for the above reasons, it is not claimed to be the only choice. Indeed, there are cases where a lesser mapping rule may be acceptable, notably when the scene being projected does not possess significant information at spatial frequencies that exceed the UUT Nyquist frequency or can be filtered such that this condition can be satisfied without degradation of the validity of the simulation procedure. Furthermore, in cost terms, it is recognized that achievement of the spatial fidelity goal of a 4:1 mapping ratio may neither be feasible nor desirable. In such cases each scene projection application should be examined in order to devise an optimal strategy for ensuring that the validity of the simulation process is maintained. For example, where the UUT image is generated by using an oversampled line raster scan it may be necessary to maintain image fidelity by projecting scene information over only a limited part of the UUT field-of-view. This would be a viable procedure when a human operator is used to view the UUT image on a monitor since it is then simple for the operator to discriminate between the projected scene and the bland background that occupies the remainder of the image space. For other cases where an automated image processing system is used to generate guidance or other commands, the situation may be more difficult. The algorithms within such systems are often tuned towards the detection of edges and could home on the edge of the"

[4] A number of charts have now been produced, including one in the United Kingdom, [5] and studies have confirmed their value in diagnosing growth retardation $[6,7]$. Although there are ethnic differences in birthweight [8] and fetal abdominal circumference [9], it is not known whether symphysis-fundus measurements also differ at a given gestation, between racial groups. In Bradford, outside the majority Caucasian population, the largest racial grouping is of Asian patients. $80 \\%$ of them are Pakistani, coming almost entirely from Northern rural Pakistan [10], making this a remarkably homogeneous Asian population. Between 1980 and 1985, 29.4\\% of all babies born in Bradford were born of Asian parents and only $1 \\%$ of African and West Indian parents (Bradford Maternity Statistics). The perinatal mortality rate of the Asians is considerably higher than that of the Caucasian population, who have a rate below the average for England and Wales. [10] There was a striking difference between the two main racial groups in the incidence of low birthweight (less than $2500 \\mathrm{~g}$ ) in babies born in the years 1980 to $1984 ; 8.3 \\%$ of Caucasian babies and $12.6 \\%$ of Asian babies (Bradford Maternity Statistics). In view of this, it was proposed that before introducing symphysis-fundus charts in Bradford as in other centres [5], it would be useful to compare symphysis-fundus heights in the two main racial groups to assess whether there was a difference in the symphysis-fundus height at a given gestation. Patients and methods We studied prospectively Asian patients with Asian spouses and Caucasian patients with Caucasian husbands attending antenatal clinics at Bradford Royal Infirmary and St. Luke's Hospital in Bradford. Most patients had their gestation confirmed by ultrasound scan before 20 weeks' gestation. A minority, with certain dates according to their last menstrual period, had the gestation confirmed by clinical examination before 20 weeks' gestation. Multiple and diabetic pregnancies were excluded from the study. After enrolment at booking clinic, patients were seen in the antenatal clinic from 28 weeks to delivery. Symphysis-fundus measurements were carried out, in $\\mathrm{cm}$, using a standard tape-measure, by one of two doctors (J.C.D. and J.G.T.) as part of the routine antenatal examination. Measurements were carried out from the upper border of the symphysis pubis to the uterine fundus along the longitudinal axis of the uterus with the patient supine, legs straight and an empty bladder, the tape measure being held taut on the patient's skin. In order to reduce observer bias, J.G.T. reversed the tape measure at the time of measurement, obscuring the scale, and J.C.D. marked the abdomen at the fundal end-point prior to measuring the symphysis-fundus height. The notes belonging to patients in the trial were marked to allow easy retrieval. The gestation at the time of delivery, the sex of the infant and its birthweight were recorded. Birthweight centiles were subsequently calculated from tables [11]."

By the time this book will have had the wide readership it deserves, it is likely that in both Israel and Turkey other elections will have been held. The authors have given us a useful reference to analyze them, both in terms of the trends within the individual countries, and the degree to which broader generalizations made by the authors will continue to be valid. Rutgers University Newark, N.J. WALTER F. WEIKER YAACOV RO'I, Soviet Decision Making in Practice: The USSR and Israel, 1947-1954 (New Brunswick, N.J.: Transaction Books, 1980). Pp. 540. This well-documented and exhaustive study provides a convincing explanation for the complete volte-face executed by Soviet policy toward Israel between 1947 and 1954, a period in which the Soviet Union abandoned its original all-out support for the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine in favor of an avowedly pro-Arab attitude. In preparing this work, the author, who is Senior Lecturer in Russian History at Tel Aviv University and head of its Russian and East European Research Center, has drawn upon the resources of that center and of the Reuven Shiloah Center for Middle Eastern and African Studies, likewise an affiliate of Tel Aviv University. He has made extensive use of Israeli, British, American and United Nations archival material, as well as a large number of books and articles cited in his bibliography. Especially noteworthy are his frequent quotations from the news media, particularly those in the Soviet Union. The result is an analysis of Soviet policy which is clearly definitive. Professor Ro'i's principal thesis is that the Soviet Union favored the establishment of the Jewish state \"in order to eject the British from Palestine. Once this preliminary goal had been attained, Moscow continued to support Israel in order to help it consolidate its independence and achieve viability, for the Soviet leadership appreciated that only a strong Israel would be able to preserve its sovereignty in a hostile environment. An Israel that had come to stay would serve the further purpose of fomenting unrest in the countries of the Arab East, thus promoting the ultimate goal of depriving the Western powers of their influence there\" (p. 400). Ro'i argues that the USSR came out for the partition of Palestine in 1947 not because it was well disposed toward the idea of a Jewish state as such but rather because power politics dictated that partition was a \"sine qua non for putting an end to British rule and military presence\" (pp. 96-97). The Soviet leadership also perceived that partition would plant a \"seed of discord between Washington and London\" (p. 132). Ro'i considers that 1949 was a watershed year in Soviet-Israeli relations. He views the conclusion of the Armistice agreements and the admission of Israel to the United Nations as the culmination of the process through which British military influence was eliminated from Palestine. Prior to 1949, he sees Israeli and Soviet interests as coinciding, especially in the United Nations, while subsequent to that time it became more and more to the Soviet advantage to cultivate the Arab world. In the years following 1949, the Soviet Union continued to pursue the goal of seeking the expulsion of Western, particularly British, influence from the area. Ro'i comments: \"In addition, two other aims - ancilliary in the previous period - now became major Soviet ambitions: to restrict the U.S.A.'s efforts to strengthen its own military and political status in the Arab world and to neutralize the region vis-à-vis Western military strategic planning\" (p. 400).

                "value": " ND axons were distributed widely throughout both the proximal and distal parts of the penis (Fig. 2a-e). Most of these axons were varicose and very fine and they were generally more prevalent in the tissues of the proximal region. Endothelial cells lining many blood vessels were more faintly stained, whereas within the cavernous spaces some groups of endothelial cells exhibited darker staining (Fig. 2f). ND epithelial cells lined the urethra (Fig. 2d). The majority of blood vessels throughout the penis were supplied by very fine, varicose ND axons (Fig. 2ac). Particularly delicate ND axons were associated with tissues of the skin of the distal penis, including the blood vessels, smooth muscle and, occasionally, approaching the epithelium (Fig. 2c). In the proximal penis fine ND axons in the outer tissues were sparser, but bundles of non-varicose ND axons were more common, than in the distal penis. Near the urethral epithelium varicose ND axons formed a dense plexus of very delicate fibres (Fig. 2d). ND axons were also located near some surfaces of the trabeculae of the cavernous spaces and amongst the connective tissues of the corpora cavernosa (Fig. 2e). ND somata and varicose axons were prevalent in sections of rectum, the somata restricted to the myenteric plexus and the axons to the circular and longitudinal muscle layers. No ND axons were found within sections of bladder wall. These studies have shown that many rat pelvic neurons contain NADPH diaphorase activity and therefore probably contain NOS. The distribution of these neurons within the MPG and penile nerve is identical to that of retrogradely-labelled penile neurons, which are concentrated near and within the penile nerve and constitute the vast majority of pelvic neurons in this area $[3,4,11]$. Further pieces of evidence to suggest that the NADPH diaphorase-stained cells project to the penis are: (1) many deeply stained axons are found in the penile nerve, and (2) stained varicose axons are widely distributed to many structures within the penis. Although the MPG is the likely origin of many axons within the penis, additional sources may exist (e.g., sensory or sympathetic ganglia). A sensory origin is quite possible for the skin innervation, as ND staining has been observed in rat sacral dorsal root ganglia [1]. The results have not ruled out the possibility that some ND pelvic neurons (such as those located more ventrally or in the accessory ganglia) project to targets other than the penis. The present study eliminated the possibility of a projection to the bladder, but the rectum remains another potential target. Many ND axons were found in this tissue and, although some of these may arise from the ND somata of enteric neurons, an extrinsic source from the MPG could not be discounted. ND axons in the accessory reproductive organs were not investigated. In conclusion, relaxation of cavernous smooth muscle, as well as dilation of other penile vascular beds during erection, may involve neurons which contain NOS. Virtually all of the MPG neurons which project to the penis contain VIP $[3,4,11]$, and many are cholinergic [7]. The present studies have labelled a similar number of MPG neurons with the NADPH diaphorase technique as labelled previously with retrograde tracing from the penis, and so it is likely that many MPG neurons which project to the penis contain the combination of VIP, acetylcholine and NOS. Activation of these neurons could therefore elicit the release of one or more of these vasodilators. The role of each of these substances and their possible interactions with the NOS of endothelial origin, will be important to establish. I wish to thank Mandy Bauer for excellent technical assistance.

Not often has The American Geographical Society had the privilege of honoring an individual whose contributions to geography have been seminal in four fields of research. Tonight we are so privileged. The fields are urban geography, economic geography, Soviet studies, and geographical bibliography. A dominant focus in urban geography is conceptualized, theoretical research. The person whom we honor now was not only a pioneer in foraging this thrust but also has provided a body of enduring analytical substance for the field. He has played a similar role in economic geography, where his theoretical approaches have been innovative and have directly and indirectly influenced a host of researchers throughout the world. At a time when many theoretical analysts in geography eschewed regional studies, the person whom we now honor became a pivotal figure in Soviet studies in the United States. His emphasis has been on the urban and economic geography of the Soviet Union. His work has repeatedly demonstrated the utility and the importance of regional applications of theoretical approaches. Additionally, he has revealed his considerable skills as linguist and diplomat. The amount of publication in the field of geography since 1950 has been incalculable. This individual alone not only kept abreast of this outflow but has made it accessible to the international scholarly community through a series of up-to-date, impeccably accurate bibliographies, listing publications in many languages. He is the geographical bibliographer par excellence. In honoring this scholar, The American Geographical Society acclaims his varied intellectual contributions to American and international geography, but it is appropriate that we also celebrate a special bond in expressing our heartfelt gratitude for his long, loyal devotion to the Society as Fellow, Councilor, and officer. The American Geographical Society proudly awards the Cullum Geographical Medal to Chauncy D. Harris. The Council, Fellows, and staff of the American Geographical Society congratulate the four new medalists for their outstanding achievements. Their names are welcomed additions to the rolls of previous recipients, who include geographical illuminaries such as Vidal de la Blache, Albrecht Penck, Ellen Churchill Semple, and Carl O. Sauer."

Here is a work of erudition and imagination all compact, and it would be no easy thing to say which of the two predominates. Certainly no more venturesome excursion into the upper air of old Greek thought has recently been made, nor has any earlier aëronaut taken in more ballast. Since Max Müller determined that mythology was a mere disease of language, and so unlocked the secret of the universal sun-myth - a solution in good part anticipated by Theagenes of Megara four and twenty centuries ago-we have had nothing more consistent and thoroughgoing than this theogony of Otto Gilbert. Short work he makes of the crass old mythology: \"Es hat keine Götter gegeben, die auf der Erde sich umhergetrieben, am irdischen Weine sich berauscht, auf irdischen Böcken und Stieren geritten, mit irdischen Dingen Spiel und Unfug getrieben haben.... Das Leben der Götter ist ein himmlisches: am Himmel ziehen sie ihre Bahnen; aus der Höhe des Himmels offenbaren sie sich..... Mythen sind Erzahlungen von den Geschehnissen seiner Götter, die 'heiligen Geschichten' von den Personen des Himmels.\" (P. 3.) In short, the religion of the oldest Hellene is a pure Himmelsglaube. He regards the blue vault above him as a divine person, from whom all blessings flow and all bane as well; for Heaven himself is ruled by two eternally warring powers, Darkness and Light. This is the Hellenic trinity : the Heaven-Father (Zeiv $\\pi \\alpha \\tau \\dot{\\eta} \\rho$ ) and his offspring, Darkness and Light, two persons manifest in many forms and under many names; and about this trinity revolves the total life of heaven."

Positive results from a battery of properly validated shortterm tests, while not adequate for classification when taken alone, may serve as supporting evidence for animal data and increase the confidence for classifying a substance as a proven animal carcinogen. Failure to find such supporting evidence could lead to a lowered classification. (c) Structure-activity relationship. Structure-activity relationships (SARs) are not at present reliable enough to play a role in decisions which have implications for human health and they cannot be used to support the classification of a substance as a carcinogen, except in a few cases where particularly strong SARs have been established for a series of chemicals which are very closely related in structure. Category 4: Suspected Animal Chemical Carcinogenic Substances of Potential Relevance to Humans In this case there is limited evidence from animal studies carried out under conditions which are possibly relevant to humans, and there is no other strong supporting evidence. Some experimental results which might lead to this categorization include: (a) A small increase in the incidence of malignant tumors of significance, e.g., where background data suggest that this incidence could have occurred by chance, particularly if this is only toward the end of the animal's natural life span. (b) An increased incidence of malignant tumors in only one species or strain, which does not meet the biological and statistical criteria necessary to be classified as a proven animal carcinogen as described in Category 3. (c) An increased incidence of malignant tumors only in organs for which the natural incidence is high or variable. (d) Malignant systemic tumors are induced only by routes of exposure which are not relevant to human exposure (see comment below). (e) Other information suggests that limited animal data are not relevant to humans, for example, when extensive and valid epidemiological studies have given no evidence of a carcinogenic effect. (f) A treatment-related increase is observed only of nonmalignant tumors which are well known to progress to malignancy. It should be noted that results from some routes of administration, e.g., subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, and intraperitoneal treatment, are typically not reliable indicators of carcinogenicity. A very careful interpretation of results obtained by such exposure routes is necessary. The subcutaneous route particularly gives falsepositive findings and much caution should be exercised in interpreting the data especially when only local tumor formation is induced. A careful interpretation of results obtained by intragastric intubation (gavage) is also necessary. Category 5: Substances Nonclassifiable with Regard to Carcinogenicity This category includes substances for which some experimental evidence exists, but the evidence is limited in strength and/or is irrelevant to the human situation.

PROGRESS IN RUSSIA Miss Ida Hoffman, graduate of the German Hospital, New York, is doing pioneer hospital reform work in Russia and sends the following interesting letter:  Spital Kanstadt Malz,  Radigescht, Lodz, Russia, October 7, 1913.  DEAR - : I know you will be interested to know how I have settled here. After my arrival I found the hospital for which I have been engaged not finished, and it will be so only in about two months from now. The man who wrote me to come, seems a good business man, but I doubt if he really is in sympathy with all my plans. At first I have seen several physicians here (which was probably wrong as they have discouraged me). They all told me that I should go back to America; that hospitals here cannot possibly be run differently than they run them here; that I will not get girls willing to learn nursing, and do the work, etc. They also told me that the superintendent of that new hospital is not an honest man, and other very discouraging things. One day I had occasion to meet the head physician of my new hospital, who is a woman of most interesting personality. After seeing her I have made up my mind to remain. I am now waiting impatiently for my work to begin, though I know it will not be easy. I have looked up another nurse from America, who came to Warsaw for the same purpose as that which brought me here. That nurse has more favorable conditions to work with. The benefactress of her hospital is a young woman, a graduate physician, who also took a course in nursing in a London hospital, and knows more about nursing than the superintendent of my hospital. She has decided to plan for a training school. They have made the educational standard for admittance a full gymnasium ${ }^{1}$ course. Should they succeed, which I am sure they will, then I think the other hospitals will follow in trying to improve things, and I cannot see why another hospital like mine with the same aims should not have the same advantages also. I have visited lots of other hospitals here and must say that in the last eight years they have been somewhat improved. One hospital here stands out as a model one, of which I would like to tell you. It was built several years ago by one of the millionares here, and he saved no money to make it model. And really, it is clean. At the head of that hospital is a German lady (not a nurse), who must be a splendid manager, for one can see that there system prevails. About the nursing, they have it arranged this way: Each ward of sixteen beds has two 1 High school."

                "value": " INTRODUCTION There are some data that in eukaryotic cells components involved in protein synthesis could be bound to the cytoskeletal structures. Biochemical results showed that polysomes, mRNA and several initiation factors bound to the Triton-insoluble material of the cells where all main cytoskeletal structures were preserved (Lenk et al., 1977; Bonneau et al., 1985; Howe and Hershey, 1984). Using immunogold microscopy Singer et al. (1989) showed, that actin, tubulin and vimentin mRNAs bound to actin filaments. Zumbe et al. (1982) claimed that the antibody to the $50 \\mathrm{kDa}$ mRNA cap-binding protein stained the intermediate filaments in BHK-21 cells. In our earlier work we showed that EF-2, the eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF-2) and ribosomes in mouse embryo fibroblasts were located mainly in the perinuclear region of these cells (Gavrilova et al., 1987). However, in many cells we observed also staining of the straight cables similar in the distribution to that of the actin microfilament bundles. Here we studied this phenomenon in greater detail and found that EF-2 is located along many (but not all) of the actin microfilament bundles in the cultured mouse embryo fibroblasts. MATERIALS AND METHODS Antibodies. Immunization of the animals was done with EF-2 purified from rat liver according to Motuz et al. (1984). In brief, the purification of rat liver EF-2 was as follows. A crude supernatant fraction from rat livers was subsequently purified by chromatography on DEAE-cellulose, hydroxylapatite, phosphocellulose, DEAE-Sephadex A-50 and Ultrogel AcA 44. EF-2 preparation was judged pure by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and assayed by its ADP-ribosylation catalyzed by the A-fragment of diphtheria toxin and by its activity in poly(U)-dependent system of poly-Phe synthesis. Rabbits were immunized with EF-2 denatured with $5 \\%$ trichloroacetic acid and the goats with the native protein solution in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). After denaturation the protein pellets were washed with acetone, dried and resuspended in PBS. The suspension or protein solution were emulsified with complete Freund's adjuvant at a ratio of $1: 1(\\mathrm{v} / \\mathrm{v})$ and injected into the popliteal lymph nodes $(0.5 \\mathrm{mg}$ per node). Rabbits were boosted in an ear vein with a solution of EF-2 in PBS 40"

Possibly this may be found useful at some later time. Upon arrival at the laboratory the samples were transferred to wide, open-mouthed jars. An examination was made of each sample immediately, and for a week or so, on each succeeding day, with the view of keeping record of the new species which emerged from encystment with the gradual stagnation and putrification of the water, for except in a very few cases the samples contained algae or other vegetal matter. The small bolting silk net shown in Fig. 3 was used for concentrating the infusoria content of one or more pipettefuls of water from the middle or bottoms of the samples where the water was usually more or less clear. No concentration methods were needed in the examination of the surface scum of the putrescing material. All measurements were made with an ocular micrometer, or from a ruled millimeter slide, from retarded living, or freshly killed specimens. The characters which are, perhaps, the most satisfactory for use in the identification of the living animals are: the contour of the body, the positions of the buccal cavity and of the largest contractile vacuole, and the disposition of the cilia. Killing and staining, or intra vitam staining may make apparent the structure of the pharynx and also of the nuclear elements. This treatment may sometimes be necessary for bringing out of the cilia. Methods of post mortem and of intra vitam staining will be discussed later. For the first examination of samples a small drop of water was taken from the top scum, or from concentrated material (the results of straining) and mixed with an equal volume of very viscous gelatine solution, and the whole thoroughly stirred together on the slide with a curved needle. ${ }^{3}$ Or often several drops were mixed with an equal part of the gelatine in a watch crystal and used on the slide when needed. The drop on the slide was now carefully flattened out and examined without a cover glass under low power ( $16 \\mathrm{~mm}$. objective and $4 \\mathrm{x}$ eyepiece) to ascertain if the solution were of a viscosity great enough to check sufficiently the movement of the protozoa. If not, it was allowed to concentrate still more by evaporation, until properly viscous, and a cover glass applied. Magnification with the $16 \\mathrm{~mm}$. objective and the $4 \\mathrm{x}$ and $10 \\mathrm{x}$ eyepieces, and with the $4 \\mathrm{~mm}$. objective, and the same two eyepieces was usually found of sufficient strength for the determination of the species described in this paper.

McNcer and Cantin (27) found few patients surviving 5 years, if they developed evidence of local or regional failure within 6 months of definitive surgery. Otherwise, about $20 \\%$ attained clinical cure after surgical resection of local and/or regional relapse without additional adjunctive therapy. Mundith et al. (32) also found patients with recurrence or metastasis disease soon after initial treatment had a poor prognosis. If this occurred less than a year after treatment only $8 \\%$ survived 5 years and none survived 10 years. In contrast, $41 \\%$ of those patients in whom relapses appeared more than 2 years after treatment survived 5 years and $20 \\%$ were alive after 10 years. Trcidma:1 and McNcer (44) showed that the highest mortality occurred within the first year of local recurrence or metastasis; then the fall off became steadily progressive, with little drop between the fourth and fifth year. In general, 5-year survival rates have been considered in many observers as equivalent to cure for patients with melanoma. However, Allen and Spitz (1) showed that among 500 fatal cases, $13 \\%$ died of their metastasis 5 years or longer after their initial treatment. These include $11 \\%$ who died 5-10 years, and $2 \\%$ who died 10 years after first presentation. Of 164 patients with loco-regional and distant metastasis, Nathanson et al. (33) found that $30 \\%$ survived 5 years and of the 5-year survivors, $30 \\%$ achieved an additional 5 years of life. High-risk factors for loco-regional recurrences McNeer and Cantin (27) correlated loco-regional recurrences (Types 1, B) according to location, status of regional nodes, and type of surgical treatment. They found a higher occurrence of failures associated with melanoma of the head and neck, and lesions distal to elbows and knees, probably due to inadequate primary excision. Incidence of loco-regional recurrences in patients with head and scek melanomas and positive nodes was $45 \\%$, as contrasted with $15 \\%$ of those with Stage I lesions. Patients with Stage I melanoma of the trunk or extremities had a low incidence $(8 \\%)$ as contrasted with $14-21 \\%$ of those with Stage II lesions. For Stage II melanomas proximal to the elbows and knees that required amputation and lymph node dissection, the recurrence rate was $63 \\%$ ( 5 out of 8 ). Overall, they showed that adequate treatment of melanoma is followed by local failure in $9 \\%$ of patients with Stage I lesions, and in $21 \\%$ of those with Stage II melanomas. McCarthy et al. (25) also reported a $16 \\%$ (7 out of 44) incidence of in-transit recurrence after histologically negative groin dissections. After groin dissection with positive nodes, the incidence of in-transit disease increased to $31 \\%$ (6 out of 19 ). Cochran (7) separated melanoma according to locations: sunlight exposed locations and clothing covered locations. Melanoma of covered site (trunk) had a higher rate of dissemination than exposed sites $(64 \\%$ vs. $41 \\%)$. In his series, in-transit metastasis only occurred in lesions greater than $1 \\mathrm{~cm}$ in diameter. Patients with Stage I melanomas who had double excision of primary lesions had lower local recurrence than those who had only single excision ( $5 \\%$ vs. $27 \\%$ ), so was their dissemination rate ( $33 \\%$ vs. $43 \\%$ ). However, the incidence of nodal and in-transit metastasis were similar. In the literature, reports often combine patients with Stage I or II melanomas. The rate of loco-regional relapses varied from 3 to $50 \\%$ (Table 3 ), and the rate of systemic metastasis from 11 to $32 \\%$. The rate of regional node relapses (Type C) was highest"

In order to observe a physisorption system and a thick insulator film, we have developed an extremely low-current low energy electron diffraction (XLEED) apparatus equipped with a microchannel plate and a position-sensitive detector in place of a phosphor screen in an ordinary LEED optics. The ellipsometric adsorption isotherms of Xe/Ag (111) at substrate temperatures between 50 and $80 \\mathrm{~K}$ were obtained in the wide pressure range between $10^{-7}$ and $1 \\mathrm{~Pa}$. We observed the surface structure by XLEED while monitoring the layer growth by the ellipsometry from a submonolayer to a thick film where the equilibrium pressure was nearly equal to the bulk saturation vapor pressure. The Xe overlayer of a sufficiently thick film has clear (111) structure which keeps relative orientation to the Ag (111) substrate. (C) 1998 American Vacuum Society. [S0734-2101(98)03303-X]  I. INTRODUCTION Physisorption systems on microscopically smooth crystal surfaces have been studied for their interesting twodimensional phase transitions. The most fundamental and straightforward way in the experimental study of a physisorption system is the measurement of the adsorption isotherm which shows the relation between the amount of adsorbed molecules per unit area of the substrate surface and the equilibrium vapor pressure at the constant temperature. On exfoliated graphite as an adsorbent, which has a chemically inert and homogeneous surface and has a large specific area, adsorption isotherms for various adsorbate have been measured using volumetry method and the nature of phase transitions and phase diagrams have already been clarified for rare gases, hydrocarbons, and so on. The ellipsometric studies of rare gases physisorbed on a single crystal surface of graphite have been reported by a few groups. ${ }^{1-3}$ These groups have revealed a variety of growth modes which appeared in submonolayer range and at substantial thickness in equilibrium with vapor phase and gained an insight into two-dimensional properties like wetting, surface melting, surface roughening, and so on. They have also shown that the ellipsometry had several advantages to the experimental study of physisorption; no restriction of operating pressure, applicability to a wide variety of samples, no influence of the capillary condensation, and no damage to the sample. However there are few effective probes for the study of a thick film physisorbed on a surface of a metal single crystal. Synchrotron x-ray diffraction has been developed in recent years as a technique for monitoring a surface structure during film growth by Dai et al. ${ }^{4}$ They observed a Xe film physisorbed on the $\\mathrm{Ag}$ (111) surface, which was thicker than 220 $\\AA$ and was the thickest Xe film yet demonstrated by a direct \\footnotetext{ a) Author to whom correspondence should be addressed; electronic mail: 96241001@gakushuin.ac.jp } measurement analogous to ellipsometry. However most of the experimental studies of physisorbed layers on metals have utilized techniques of electron diffractions and electron spectroscopies. Chesters et al. ${ }^{5}$ observed that the Xe monolayer on $\\mathrm{Ag}$ (111) surface was a triangular lattice which was incommensurate but aligned with the substrate, using low energy electron diffraction (LEED). McElhiney et al. ${ }^{6}$ have obtained adsorption isotherms by means of surface potential measurement and Auger electron spectroscopy. From the steep rise of the adsorption isotherms they found the existence of a two-dimensional phase transition within the Xe monolayer. Webb and co-workers ${ }^{7-10}$ have studied the structural and thermodynamic properties of $\\mathrm{Xe} / \\mathrm{Ag}$ (111) by LEED. The most common LEED instrument, which is equipped with either a phosphor screen or a movable Faraday cup collector, requires a long acquisition time and a large electron beam exposure which induces contamination from residual gas, defect formation, desorption, and charging on the sample. Thus it is difficult to observe a phase transition of an adsorbed film in equilibrium with environment. In order to minimize these effects, it is necessary to reduce the total electron dose to obtain LEED profiles. We have developed an extremely low-current low energy electron diffraction (XLEED) apparatus equipped with a micro-channel plate (MCP) and a position-sensitive detector in place of a phosphor screen in an ordinary LEED optics. A similar system has already been described by Stair ${ }^{11}$ and Leclerc et al. ${ }^{12}$ Our experimental apparatus makes it possible to observe a layer growth and an adsorbate structure simultaneously with a minimum effect of defect formation and charging on the surface. The first preliminary result of ellipsometric measurement of the adsorption isotherms of a rare gas on a metal surface has been reported by Itakura and Arakawa. ${ }^{13}$ They found that $\\mathrm{Xe} / \\mathrm{Ag}(111)$ and $\\mathrm{Xe} / \\mathrm{Pt}(111)$ grew layer by layer up to at"

                "value": " New thrombolytics look as good as alteplase  -Tracey Earl and Carmen Walsh- Delegates were updated on the most recent outcomes data for 2 of the newer thrombolytics posing a threat to alteplase [t-PA], at the 48th Annual Scientific Session of the American College of Cardiology [New Orleans, US; March 1999]. Data presented from InTIME II* and ASSENT 2** showed that lanoteplase [nPA] and tenecteplase [TNK-tPA] have similar effects to alteplase on mortality in patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI). Tenecteplase is a genetically engineered variant of alteplase. It is based on alteplase, but several amino acid substitutions result in tenecteplase having a longer half-life, increased fibrin specificity and increased resistance to inhibition by plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, compared with alteplase. Lanoteplase is a genetically engineered plasminogen activator, and like tenecteplase, has a long half-life and increased fibrin specificity. The fact that tenecteplase or lanoteplase can be administered as a single bolus dose gives these drugs advantages over alteplase, which is given as a 90-minute infusion. Namely, the more convenient dosing regimen may lead to their prehospital use, permitting earlier treatment and, consequently, more lives being saved. Also, there is less potential for dosing errors. Lanoteplase InTIME with alteplase Dr Karl-Ludwig Neuhaus from Staedtische Kliniken, Germany, presented results from the InTIME II trial. ${ }^{1}$ The trial recruited 15078 patients from 855 centres in 35 countries. It compared the 30-day outcomes of patients with MI treated with lanoteplase or alteplase. Patients were randomised to receive a single bolus of IV lanoteplase $120000 \\mathrm{U} / \\mathrm{kg}$ or alteplase $\\leq 100 \\mathrm{mg}$ as a 90 -minute IV infusion. All patients received concomitant treatment with aspirin and heparin. Dr Neuhaus said that lanoteplase was as effective as alteplase at decreasing 30-day mortality [see table]. Interestingly, the 24-hour mortality was slightly better in lanoteplase recipients compared with alteplase recipients. This was despite lanoteplase being associated with significantly more intracranial and mild bleeding. Intracranial bleeding occurred in 1.13 vs $0.62 \\%$ of lanoteplase and alteplase recipients, respectively $(p \\leq 0.01)$. Mild bleeding occurred in $19.6 \\mathrm{vs} 14.7 \\%$ of lanoteplase and alteplase recipients, respectively $(p \\leq 0.01)$. Dr Neuhaus added that it is predicted there will be no differences between lanoteplase and alteplase in mortality or net clinical outcome at 6 months. Tenecteplase climbs up beside alteplase Tenecteplase has been studied in clinical trials involving more that 21000 patients with acute MI worldwide. The phase II TIMI $10 \\mathrm{~B}^{\\dagger}$ and ASSENT 1 trials evaluated early coronary patency rates, the rate of intracranial haemorrhage and overall safety of 3 doses of tenecteplase. The promising outcomes of these studies led to phase III testing in ASSENT 2. Dr Frans Van de Werf from University Hospital Gasthuisberg, Belgium, presented results from ASSENT 2. ${ }^{2}$ The trial recruited 16950 patients with acute MI from 1021 centres in 29 countries. Patients presenting within 6 hours of the onset of symptoms were randomised to receive IV tenecteplase $30-50 \\mathrm{mg}$ or IV alteplase as a 90 -minute accelerated infusion. The dose of tenecteplase was weight-adjusted; patients received a bolus of $30-50 \\mathrm{mg}$ depending on bodyweight. Dr Van de Werf said that the mortality rate at 30 days was $6.15-6.17 \\%$ with both tenecteplase and alteplase administration. In addition, the rate of total stroke was 1.78 and $1.66 \\%$ with tenecteplase and alteplase administration, respectively. Interestingly, subgroup analyses revealed no differences between the 2 treatment groups in 30-day mortality, although there was a $2 \\%$ difference in favour of tenecteplase in patients treated within 4 hours of symptom onset. The incidence of ischaemia was lower in women and patients aged $>75$ years who had received tenecteplase compared with alteplase.  Lower frequency of bleeding Dr Van de Werf said that the risks of intracranial haemorrhage were similar with tenecteplase and alteplase administration $(0.93$ vs $0.94 \\%$ of patients, respectively), but the incidence of other bleeding was significantly lower after tenecteplase administration (26 vs $28.1 \\%$, respectively). Transfusion for serious bleeding was significantly less frequent in tenecteplase vs alteplase recipients ( 4.3 vs $5.5 \\%$, respectively). Dr Van de Werf noted that this lower frequency of bleeding may be explained by the increased fibrin specificity of tenecteplase compared with alteplase. Dr Van de Werf said that 'the ASSENT 2 investigators are pleased that the study has demonstrated the anticipated results, showing that TNK-tPA provided patient outcomes at 30 days that are virtually identical to alteplase with less bleeding and greater * InTIME = Intranvenous nPh for Treating Infecting Myocardium Early ** ASSENT = Assessment of the Safety and Efficacy of a New Thrombolytic agent †TIMI = Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction [see Inpharma 1171: 8, 23 Jan 1999; 800734038] See also Inpharma 1104: 9, 13 Sep 1997; 800458773 and Inpharma 1081: 11-12, 5 Apr 1997; 800458464"

                "value": " The lesson of these two cases we trust may not be lost upon those members of the judiciary who are so ready to lend the use of the extraordinary writ of injunction to any corporation seeking its aid against state regulation. Our whole Injunctions. system of Legislative regulation and the very autonomy of the states has been threatened by the reckless way in which judges have granted this writ. It has become in the hands of many judicial pigmies a very giant of oppression and from being an \"extraordinary\" writ has become a very \"ordinary\" one. We have never believed in this process being made the football of political partizanship, and have taken no stock in the cry that has been raised for its regulation by Legislative or Congressional enactment. Sbund judicial common sense ought to regulate it sufficiently. There would be great dauger of denial of justice in many cases by the passage of a general law regulating the use of the writ. It is a most wise and salutary process when used in a wise way and granted only after careful consideration. Its reckless use in the hands of judges who value power above prudence, may end in its destructionand with it will go one of the greatest safeguards to the right of property. Might it not be well for the great corporations to try the plan of obeying a law a little while before they rush into the courts to question its constitutionality? That they must do this in rate matters seems to be the keynote of this decision. The Supreme Court of the United States on January 5th refused unanimously, without giving any reasons, the writ of certiorari seeking a review on the part of the Government of the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals reversing The Unit of in the Standard Oil case the lower Court, which Offense. had fined this Company $\\$ 29,240.00$. An interesting question is raised as to what is \"the unit of offense.\" The lower Court held it to be the car-load. The Appellate Court held this to be incorrect. Then is it the shipment or the settlement which is to be taken into account in fixing the penalty for violation? As has been suggested, if the settlement is to be the unit, the law can easily be avoided to a great extent"

Hawābah hawābah! ${ }^{285}$ The lightning and the rain-cloud! 2. So-and-so, son of so-and-so (feminine), ${ }^{286}$ The husks ${ }^{287}$ have made him fall. (?) 3. I have drawn ${ }^{288}$ him with a leather vessel (mirkan) ${ }^{289}$ And his love ${ }^{290}$ has grown strong (tamakkan). ${ }^{291}$ 4. I have drawn ${ }^{288}$ him with a needle ('brah), He has not slept ${ }^{292}$ for weeping ('abrah). 5. I have drawn ${ }^{293}$ him with an awl ('išfa), His heart will not recover (yušfa). ${ }^{294}$ 282 Cf. Hamzah $Z A, 276$; Liedn XVIII, 273. ${ }^{288}$ MS and Husayn, bayna samd, which is meaningless; the correction is from Liedn and Hamzah $Z A$. ${ }^{286}$ Cf. Hamzah $Z A, 275$; Ibn Abī 1-Hadid, IV, 615. ${ }^{288}$ Thus in MS, Hamzah $Z A$, and Ibn Abī 1-Hadid. Husayn changes the spelling, apparently intending to read hawan bihi hawan bihi, \" love in him, love in him.\" It seems better to retain the reading of the MS and call the phrase a magic formula without any real meaning. ${ }^{286}$ This line does not follow the meter; here one is evidently supposed to insert the name of the person who is being charmed. ${ }^{287}$ MS, fusaqa $l$ 'aqab ih (?), which I have corrected to al-jafd. Hamzah $Z A$, \"At the place where the'$q \\bar{a} b a h$ fell.\" The form'$q \\bar{a} b a h$ is not found in the dictionaries, and if correct, would require a feminine verb in the MS. So it seems better to split the word in two, though the meaning is still not clear. Ibn Abī 1-Hadid omits this verse. 288 Ibn Abī 1-Hadid, \" charmed.\" 288 Hamzah $Z A$, marka, \"place where something is fixed,\" which seems unlikely, but see note 291, below. ${ }^{290}$ Ibid., jubbuhu, \"his well, or bag\"; doubtless a misprint for bubbuhu, \"his love.\" ${ }^{281}$ Ibid., murakkaz, \"fixed,\" from the same root as markaz. ${ }^{292}$ Ibn Abī 1-Hadid, \"May he not cease from weeping.\" ${ }^{293}$ Ibid., \"I have left him alone with $\\mathrm{t}!!$.\" ${ }^{294}$ Ibid., \"His heart will not be at ease.\" 6. I have drawn ${ }^{295}$ him with a punch (mis$\\operatorname{rad}),{ }^{296}$ And his heart will not become cold. (yabrud) [fol. 106a].\" Abū 1-Mundir said, ${ }^{297}$ \"One of their incantations when someone they detested departed-and the woman who disliked her husband did it too, when her husband departed ${ }^{288}$ was: In the dark of the moon and the shade of trees, the Northwind encompass him, ${ }^{299}$ the Westwind follow behind him, the North-eastwind afflict him; may he be pricked by a thorn ${ }^{300}$ and not pluck it out. ${ }^{301}$ \"Then she throws a pebble, ${ }^{302}$ a date-stone, a piece of horse dung, ${ }^{303}$ and a piece of sheep-dung after him, and says: ${ }^{304}$ Pebble (hașāh), may his footsteps be cut short (husșa); ${ }^{305}$ date-stone 295 Ibn Abī 1-Hadid, \"I have left him alone with - -.\" 296 Hamzah $Z A$ and Ibn Abī 1-Hadid read \"file\" (mibrad), which seems better, since it comes from the same root as yabrud, \"become cold.\" 297 Cf. Hamzah $Z A, 275$; Ibn Abī 1-Hadid, IV, 615. 298 This is the only use of the charm that Hamzah and Ibn Abī 1-Hadid mention. 299 This verb and the ones following are derived from the same roots as the names of the winds with which they are used. They all convey the idea of doing ill, bringing bad luck, etc. ${ }^{300}$ MS śika; Hamzah $Z A$ reads śila, \"may be raised up.\" ${ }^{301}$ MS, la ntayaś; Hamzah $Z A$, la nta'aś, \"may he not rise up\"; in both these cases, the readings of Hamzah are doubtless corruptions of the correct form as given by Ibn Abī Sarh. ${ }^{303}$ The throwing of pebbles as a charm is well known. Muhammad, the prophet, assured the victory of his forces against the pagans at the battle of Hunayn by throwing pebbles at the foe and exclaiming, \"May they be defeated, by the Lord of the Ka'bah; may they be defeated, by the Lord of the Ka'bah!\" See Ahmad b. Hanbal, Munad, I, 207. ${ }^{302}$ I have translated rauțah as horse-dung and ba'rah as sheep-dung; they may refer, however, to the dung of any solid-hoofed animal, and of any cloven-hoofed animal respectively. ${ }^{304}$ Liedn, XII, 363 gives a somewhat different version on the authority of Abū 'Ubaydah: \"When a man and wife loathe one another and he leaves, she sends after him a date-stone, saying, 'Your journey's end be far'; then a piece of horse-dung, saying, 'I have elegized you, may news of you be delayed'; then a pebble, saying, 'May your sustenance turn away, and may your footsteps be cut short.\" ${ }^{305}$ MS and Hamzah $Z A$ correctly read husșa. Mittwoch makes the same correction as Husayn, i. e., to bușiya, \"may (his footsteps) be pelted\" from the same root as the word for pebble. However, it seems best"

The real effect of their relieving the local authorities of the duty of providing local hospitals was to put an unknown and impossible amount of labour on the Metropolitan Asylums Board. Evidence of this crops up at every point of the Hampstead inquiry. The managers were from the commencement in the dark. They proposed to erect three small-pox hospitals, each to contain a hundred beds; but there was not the remotest probability of this number being sufficient to meet the case, and experience has proved that nearly ten times that number were required. Even this intention was frustrated by the Poor-law Board, and, under a fit of economy, the proposed hospital at Hampstead was given up. Then came relapsing fever; and whilst giving the managers the fullest credit for intelligence and zeal, and for the erection of what we regard as the most successful hospital structures in existence, yet we are bound to remember that the arrangements were only just completed as the epidemic ceased, and that the hospital was closed just at the moment when it might have been of the greatest use in checking the rising epidemic of small-pox. The fact is that the managers, not having any direct and official connexion either with medical officers of health or with the medical officers of the Privy Council, who were the only persons having knowledge of the approaching evil, had no warning that hospitals would be so soon and urgently required. Until months afterwards they had no machinery by which the increase of small-pox could be made clearly known to them, and the epidemic found them in November last utterly unprepared. All afterwards was hurry and confusion. The announcement of the opening of the Hampstead Hospital stopped all action on the part of guardians and vestries, and from that moment no amount of labour on the part of the managers or their officers sufficed to provide for the pressure. Patients were brought to the hospital doors by scores, and soon by hundreds. One after another, wards were built and opened. One after another, the hospitals were occupied in haste. The new furniture was often put in with the patients; and servants came from all sorts of doubtful sources, the power of selection being narrowed by the nature of the case. Then the kitchen arrangements were found to be upon too small a scale, and cooking became a real difficulty by the side of alterations and enlargements actually going on. Then the laundry was too small, and women could not be found to do the work, so that it became impossible to provide clean sheets for every case. Then, again, there were difficulties as regards the medical staff. The managers, unfortunately, refused to carry out the promises of Mr. Gathorne HARDY to appoint visiting physicians and surgeons, of whom any number might certainly have been secured; but they elected residents who, having enormous responsibilities and very little knowledge of the world, failed to pull together. And then the necessity for further accommodation was evident; and the chief medical officer was entrusted with the management of a convalescent hospital four miles away, when he was already overworked. His work was thenceforth doubled, and every one of the 300 patients admitted in a week had to be entered and dis- charged twice. Under such circumstances can it be a source of wonder that very grave mistakes were made. Was it extraordinary that the officers who failed to prevent the loss of a child should have found but little time to look after \"Hampstead donkeys,\" or pay much attention to the supply of towels. The whole history proves that the managers were utterly unable to replace the labours of the seventy public bodies who would have been bound to act in their respective localities if the Metropolitan Asylums Board had not been formed. No one can doubt either their zeal or industry; and the wonder is, not that there was failure, but that they did so much. We believe, therefore, that the second great lesson is, that no central board can be relied on for organising the measures necessary for meeting a great epidemic amongst a population of three millions without the assistance and cooperation of local authorities. And the problem is,-How can this assistance and co-operation be secured? No one will doubt that it is unwise to leave the question where it is. Cholera may come; and the confusion which has been characteristic of the recent epidemic, if repeated, would be fatal. The thirty boards of guardians and the forty vestries must be brought somehow into harmony with the Metropolitan Asylums Managers; and the sooner Mr. Stansfeld sets about the solution of the difficulty the more hopeful shall we be that the measures taken will be general, economical, and successful. Dr. Maudsley has recently called the attention of alienists to the very important question of the use and abuse of sedatives in the treatment of insanity. He suggests, rather than affirms, that the temporary peace obtained by the action of sedatives may be deceptive in its character, and hurtful in its eventual influence. He thinks that natural processes tending to the removal of noxious matters from the system may be arrested or checked; and that the brain-cells may be placed in a sort of chemical restraint, which, like bodily restraint, may increase the malady while it suppresses its manifestations. He asks for some experiments upon the treatment of insanity without sedatives; and relates a few cases of his own, which have done well under such management. He refers to the large use of opium that at one time prevailed in asylums, and mentions the researches of Dr. Clouston with regard to its action, which led to the conclusion that the drug \"soon lost its effect; all the patients lost weight while taking it; their average temperature fell; the pulse was lowered; and in all cases it interfered with the proper nutrition of the body, and pushed it one step farther down hill in the direction of death.\" There can be no better illustration of the influence of routine upon treatment than the fact that a medication, which showed such results to a careful and systematic observer, was for many years accepted as the practice proper to be pursued. The doubts raised by Dr. Maudsley have, it should be observed, a far wider range of application than to lunatics alone. The use of sedatives in general medicine is open to a great variety of questions, not the least important of which is the danger of causing patients to have"

New York, Oxford University Press, 1920. pp. xviii, 210. Taking as his central theme the permanent contributions of Thomas Jefferson to American political thought, Judge Swaney discusses in an accurate and entertaining way the derivation of some of the underlying principles of our modern democracy. There is a Foreword by Mr. W. G. McAdoo. The book itself consists of four chapters, each of which is a complete monograph, devoted to the Declaration of Independence, to Jefferson's legislative reforms in Virginia, to his contribution to the nation, and to a discussion of the growth and development of civil and religious liberty. The account of the genesis of the Declaration of Independence is the most valuable part of the work. The antecedents of the Declaration of Independence are not nearly so well understood as those of the Constitution. Whenever it is discussed in any terms other than those of meaningless panegyric, it is usually considered as a theoretical and abstract statement of the rights of man, the product of the mind of a single individual. Judge Swaney, however, although he does not claim for Jefferson any originality of doctrine, does specifically point out that, possessed of a literary power which few Americans have equaled, Jefferson gave an elegant forum to the principles of the most advanced English political theories. His merit was in giving to already extant radical political conceptions a trenchant and compelling statement. The practical aspect of the document, as the party platform of a radical minority presenting their cause in the best possible light, is not overlooked. The greatest service of the Declaration was as most persuasive propaganda, which served the two-fold purpose of aiding in turning a minority into a majority and of committing its supporters beyond the possibility of compromise with the home government. That it so well served its purpose is largely due to Jefferson. Judge Swaney holds that next to the drafting of the Declaration of Independence, the most important work of Jefferson was done in liberalizing legislation in Virginia. He gives an excellent account of this work, especially of the laws proposed by the committee of which Jefferson was chairman, including the repeal of the law of entails, abrogation of the law of primogeniture, and the establishment of religious freedom. The author also includes an accurate synopsis of the Virginia Bill of Rights, the significance and influence of which has not been adequately recognized by historians. A single reading of this chapter can not fail to convince one that the states have not taken advantage of the proffered opportunities for progressive legislation. It is one of the defects of our dual system that the federal government usually draws exclusively to itself the great public-spirited men who otherwise might, like Jefferson, render invaluable service to their home states."
